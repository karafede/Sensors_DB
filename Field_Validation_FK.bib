At present, various approaches are used in monitoring air quality. The core factors of these approaches are the selection and establishment of an intelligent evaluation model. In this study, we designed a fuzzy genetic neural network model that fuses data based on the characteristics of autonomic learning and self-organization and optimizes the fuzzy system by using the neural network model. A simulation was conducted to verify the feasibility of the algorithm. Results indicate that the proposed algorithm is not only a highly objective, scientific, and accurate method for detecting atmospheric environmental quality but also a practical solution.},

	abstract = {Low-cost sensing strategies hold the promise of denser air quality monitoring networks, which could significantly improve our understanding of personal air pollution exposure. Additionally, low-cost air quality sensors could be deployed to areas where limited monitoring exists. However, low-cost sensors are frequently sensitive to environmental conditions and pollutant cross-sensitivities, which have historically been poorly addressed by laboratory calibrations, limiting their utility for monitoring. In this study, we investigated different calibration models for the Real-time Affordable Multi-Pollutant (RAMP) sensor package, which measures CO, NO2, O3, and CO2. We explored three methods: (1) laboratory univariate linear regression, (2) empirical multiple linear regression, and (3) machine-learning-based calibration models using random forests (RF). Calibration models were developed for 16–19 RAMP monitors (varied by pollutant) using training and testing windows spanning August 2016 through February 2017 in Pittsburgh, PA, US. The random forest models matched (CO) or significantly outperformed (NO2, CO2, O3) the other calibration models, and their accuracy and precision were robust over time for testing windows of up to 16 weeks. Following calibration, average mean absolute error on the testing data set from the random forest models was 38 ppb for CO (14 \% relative error), 10 ppm for CO2 (2 \% relative error), 3.5 ppb for NO2 (29 \% relative error), and 3.4 ppb for O3 (15 \% relative error), and Pearson r versus the reference monitors exceeded 0.8 for most units. Model performance is explored in detail, including a quantification of model variable importance, accuracy across different concentration ranges, and performance in a range of monitoring contexts including the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and the US EPA Air Sensors Guidebook recommendations of minimum data quality for personal exposure measurement. A key strength of the RF approach is that it accounts for pollutant cross-sensitivities. This highlights the importance of developing multipollutant sensor packages (as opposed to single-pollutant monitors); we determined this is especially critical for NO2 and CO2. The evaluation reveals that only the RF-calibrated sensors meet the US EPA Air Sensors Guidebook recommendations of minimum data quality for personal exposure measurement. We also demonstrate that the RF-model-calibrated sensors could detect differences in NO2 concentrations between a near-road site and a suburban site less than 1.5 km away. From this study, we conclude that combining RF models with carefully controlled state-of-the-art multipollutant sensor packages as in the RAMP monitors appears to be a very promising approach to address the poor performance that has plagued low-cost air quality sensors.},

We measured the detection efficiency of the OPCs by size from 0.5 to 5 µm for monodispersed, polystyrene latex (PSL) spheres. We then compared number and mass concentrations measured with the OPCs to those measured with reference instruments for three aerosols: salt, welding fume, and Arizona road dust. The OPC-N2 detection efficiency was similar to the PAS-1.108 for particles larger than 0.8 µm (minimum of 79\% at 1 µm and maximum of 101\% at 3 µm). For 0.5-µm particles, the detection efficiency of the OPC-N2 was underestimated at 78\%, whereas PAS-1.108 overestimated concentrations by 183\%. The mass concentrations from the OPCs were linear (r ≥ 0.97) with those from the reference instruments for all aerosols, although the slope and intercept were different. The mass concentrations were overestimated for dust (OPC-N2, slope = 1.6; PAS-1.108, slope = 2.7) and underestimated for welding fume (OPC-N2, slope = 0.05; PAS-1.108, slope = 0.4). The coefficient of variation (CV, precision) for OPC-N2 for all experiments was between 4.2\% and 16\%. These findings suggest that, given site-specific calibrations, the OPC-N2 can provide number and mass concentrations similar to the PAS-1.108 for particles larger than 1 µm.Copyright © 2016 American Association for Aerosol Research},

Researchers are examining the sensors for their potential use in a wide range of applications, including the examination of the spatial and temporal variability of particulate matter (PM). However, few studies have quantified the performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, and reliability) of the sensors under real-world conditions. This study examined the performance of two models of PM sensors, the AirBeam and the Alphasense Optical Particle Counter (OPC-N2), over a 12-week period in the Cuyama Valley of California, where PM concentrations are impacted by wind-blown dust events and regional transport. The sensor measurements were compared with observations from two well-characterized instruments: the GRIMM 11-R optical particle counter, and the Met One beta attenuation monitor (BAM). Both sensor models demonstrated a high degree of collocated precision (R2 = 0.8–0.99), and a moderate degree of correlation against the reference instruments (R2 = 0.6–0.76). Sensor measurements were influenced by the meteorological environment and the aerosol size distribution. Quantifying the performance of sensors in real-world conditions is a requisite step to ensuring that sensors will be used in ways commensurate with their data quality.},

However, in the diverse applications these sensors face many technological challenges, including sensor drift over long-term deployment that cannot be easily addressed using mathematical correction algorithms or machine learning methods. This study aims to develop a novel approach to auto-correct the drift of commonly used electrochemical nitrogen dioxide (NO2) sensor with comprehensive evaluation of its application. The impact of environmental factors on the NO2 electrochemical sensor in low-ppb concentration level measurement was evaluated in laboratory and the temperature and relative humidity correction algorithm was evaluated. An automated zeroing protocol was developed and assessed using a chemical absorbent to remove NO2 as a means to perform zero correction in varying ambient conditions. The sensor system was operated in three different environments in which data were compared to a reference NO2 analyzer. The results showed that the zero-calibration protocol effectively corrected the observed drift of the sensor output. This technique offers the ability to enhance the performance of low-cost sensor based systems and these findings suggest extension of the approach to improve data quality from sensors measuring other gaseous pollutants in urban air.},

	abstract = {Over the past few years, many low-cost pollution sensors have been integrated into measurement platforms for air quality monitoring. However, using these sensors is challenging: concentrations of toxic substances in ambient air often lie at sensors' sensitivity boundaries, environmental conditions affect the sensor measurements, and the sensors often suffer from poor selectivity, i.e. are cross-sensitive to multiple pollutants. Datasheet information on these effects is scarce or may not cover deployment conditions. Consequently the sensors need to undergo extensive pre-deployment testing to examine their feasibility for a given application and to find the optimal measurement setup that allows accurate data collection and calibration. In this work, we propose a novel method to conduct in-field testing of low-cost sensors. The algorithm proposed is based on multiple least-squares and leverages the physical variation of urban air pollution to quantify the amount of explained and unexplained sensor signal. We verify (i) whether a sensor is feasible for air quality monitoring in a given environment and underpin our analysis with positive and negative examples of sensors available on the market, (ii) model sensor cross-sensitivities to interfering gases and environmental effects and (iii) compute the optimal sensor array and its calibration parameters for stable and accurate sensor measurements over long time periods in a given environment. Finally, we provide an experimental evaluation of our approach using over 9 million measurements of various low-cost sensors collected in an urban area. Based on the results from our testing methodology we propose an optimized sensor array setup. Further, we show—compared to a state-of-the-art calibration technique—a significantly lower calibration error with better long-time stability of the calibration parameters.},

	abstract = {The potential of inexpensive Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) gas sensors to be used for urban air quality monitoring has been the topic of increasing interest in the last decade. This paper discusses some of the lessons of three years of experience working with such sensors on a novel instrument platform (Small Open General purpose Sensor (SOGS)) in the measurement of atmospheric nitrogen dioxide and ozone concentrations. Analytic methods for increasing long-term accuracy of measurements are discussed, which permit nitrogen dioxide measurements with 95\% confidence intervals of 20.0 μ g m − 3 and ozone precision of 26.8 μ g m − 3 , for measurements over a period one month away from calibration, averaged over 18 months of such calibrations. Beyond four months from calibration, sensor drift becomes significant, and accuracy is significantly reduced. Successful calibration schemes are discussed with the use of controlled artificial atmospheres complementing deployment on a reference weather station exposed to the elements. Manufacturing variation in the attributes of individual sensors are examined, an experiment possible due to the instrument being equipped with pairs of sensors of the same kind. Good repeatability (better than 0.7 correlation) between individual sensor elements is shown. The results from sensors that used fans to push air past an internal sensor element are compared with mounting the sensors on the outside of the enclosure, the latter design increasing effective integration time to more than a day. Finally, possible paths forward are suggested for improving the reliability of this promising sensor technology for measuring pollution in an urban environment.},

	abstract = {In many urban areas the population is exposed to elevated levels of air pollution. However, air quality is usually only measured at a few locations. These measurements provide a general picture of the state of the air, but they are unable to monitor local differences. Since a few years new low-cost sensor technology is available, which has the potential to extend the official monitoring network significantly. These sensors, however, are still in an experimental stage and suffer from various technical issues which limit their applicability. This study explores the added value of alternative air quality measurements, focusing on nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. 16 low-cost air quality sensor devices were built and distributed among volunteers living close to roads with high traffic volume for a two-month measurement campaign. Careful calibration of individual sensors is essential to measure ambient concentrations of NO2 significantly. Field calibration was done next to an air monitoring station during an 8-day period, resulting in R2 ranging from 0.3 to 0.7. The NO2 accuracy can be improved by including temperature and humidity measurements from an additional low-cost sensor, R2 ranging from 0.6 to 0.9. Recalibration is crucial, as all sensors show significant signal drift after the two-month measurement campaign. The measurement series between the calibration periods can be corrected in hindsight by taking a weighted average of the calibration coefficients. Validation against an independent air monitoring station shows good agreement. Using our approach, the standard deviation of a typical sensor device for NO2 measurements was found to be 7 μg m−3. This shows that, if properly treated, low-cost sensors based on the current generations of electrochemical NO2 sensors may provide useful complementary data on local air quality in an urban setting.},

	abstract = {Recent developments in sensory and communication technologies have made the development of portable air-quality (AQ) micro-sensing units (MSUs) feasible. These MSUs allow AQ measurements in many new applications, such as ambulatory exposure analyses and citizen science. Typically, the performance of these devices is assessed using the mean error or correlation coefficients with respect to a laboratory equipment. However, these criteria do not represent how such sensors perform outside of laboratory conditions in large-scale field applications, and do not cover all aspects of possible differences in performance between the sensor-based and standardized equipment, or changes in performance over time. This paper presents a comprehensive Sensor Evaluation Toolbox (SET) for evaluating AQ MSUs by a range of criteria, to better assess their performance in varied applications and environments. Within the SET are included four new schemes for evaluating sensors' capability to: locate pollution sources; represent the pollution level on a coarse scale; capture the high temporal variability of the observed pollutant and their reliability. Each of the evaluation criteria allows for assessing sensors' performance in a different way, together constituting a holistic evaluation of the suitability and usability of the sensors in a wide range of applications. Application of the SET on measurements acquired by 25 MSUs deployed in eight cities across Europe showed that the suggested schemes facilitates a comprehensive cross platform analysis that can be used to determine and compare the sensors' performance. The SET was implemented in R and the code is available on the first author's website.},

This provides a whole new set of capabilities in the assessment of human exposure to air pollution. However, the data generated by these platforms are often of questionable quality. We have conducted an exhaustive evaluation of 24 identical units of a commercial low-cost sensor platform against CEN (European Standardization Organization) reference analyzers, evaluating their measurement capability over time and a range of environmental conditions. Our results show that their performance varies spatially and temporally, as it depends on the atmospheric composition and the meteorological conditions. Our results show that the performance varies from unit to unit, which makes it necessary to examine the data quality of each node before its use. In general, guidance is lacking on how to test such sensor nodes and ensure adequate performance prior to marketing these platforms. We have implemented and tested diverse metrics in order to assess if the sensor can be employed for applications that require high accuracy (i.e., to meet the Data Quality Objectives defined in air quality legislation, epidemiological studies) or lower accuracy (i.e., to represent the pollution level on a coarse scale, for purposes such as awareness raising). Data quality is a pertinent concern, especially in citizen science applications, where citizens are collecting and interpreting the data. In general, while low-cost platforms present low accuracy for regulatory or health purposes they can provide relative and aggregated information about the observed air quality.},

	abstract = {Identification of aircraft cabin environmental quality concerns for which sensors may be useful • The highest priority environmental indicators identified are ozone and cabin air pressure, followed by carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide with moderate priority, and then relative humidity, airborne particles, and organic contaminants, including engine oil byproducts and pesticides. This list is based on the Congressional requirements and recent scientific literature, starting with information from recent studies (NAS/NRC, ASHRAE/Battelle), and continuing by seeking input from a variety of stakeholders. • The parameters that can be monitored routinely with off-the-shelf sensor technology are ozone, cabin pressure, CO, CO2 and relative humidity. These formed the prioritized list of environmental parameters for in-flight sensing. Definition of requirements for sensor and sensor systems LBNL investigators deduced that sensors intended to provide data for routine use by stakeholders must emphasize simplicity, ruggedness and satisfactory performance with limited attention by the crew and maintenance staff. In order to guide maintenance of environmental control systems and document exposure to contaminants, sensors should be installed at multiple locations in the bleed air and cabin air supply/recirculation system, including the return duct. Packaging requirements for installation and operation on aircraft emphasize simplicity, ruggedness and satisfactory performance with limited attention by the crew and maintenance staff. Within these limits: • Specific requirements or benchmarks for performance emphasize accuracy (±15\%), sensitivity (low ambient levels), and sampling interval (≤60 s). • Suggested requirements include limitations on the size of sensor elements (≤ 3/8 in diameter), weight of sensor systems (≤1 kg), power (28 V), frequency of maintenance (coincident with service schedules), required operator skill (minimal) and target cost for replaceable sensor elements (≤ \$100). Sensor systems most capable of meeting current requirements. A survey of sensor systems, parameter by parameter, from highest priority to lowest, is included as Appendix A. Systems chosen for testing were based on principles that are representative of the main approaches that are utilized currently for real-time monitoring of the prioritized parameters. The use of COTS systems simplified the experimental approach because data from their sensors could be acquired without project staff designing and building prototype units. However, no COTS system met all the specifications or benchmarks. To proceed under this limitation, sensors judged to be most capable of meeting requirements were tested in COTS systems based on IR or UV spectroscopy, electrochemical cells, and metal oxide semiconductors. The selected technologies were based on light absorption (UV for ozone and non-dispersive IR for carbon dioxide) and electrochemistry (electrochemical cells and metal oxide semiconductors for ozone and carbon monoxide). Pressure sensors are already standard in aircraft, although the output needs to be logged. Performance of sensors Representative sensor technologies were tested in the laboratory under conditions that occur in-flight (cabin air pressure 0.7 to 1 atm; temperature from 65 to 85 °F) and at ground level (relative humidity from 20 to 80\%). The results show that neither the EC nor MOS-based sensors responded with at least ±15\% accuracy, primarily due to poor reproducibility and hysteresis. The sensors based on light absorption (UV for ozone and IR for CO2) performed better under the influence of changes in pressure, temperature and humidity than the sensors that depend on electrochemistry (for ozone and CO, analyte-induced redox reactions at sensing and counting electrodes (EC) or at the gas sensing surface of the (HMOS sensor)). The UV-based sensor gave unacceptable performance ({\textbackslash}textgreater 15\% change) only when the relative humidity exceeded 65\%, but this condition does not occur in flight because RH rarely exceeds 30\%. The optical sensors, both UV and NDIR, need further miniaturization before they can be installed routinely in aircraft. Recommendations for sensor development • Circulate the main findings of this study among sensor manufacturers to stimulate development of improved technologies. • Implement ASHRAE’s recommendations for routine monitoring to encourage aircraft-specific sensor designs. When large markets exist for monitoring aircraft cabin environmental quality (ACEQ), developers and manufacturers will have more incentive to miniaturize optical sensors and tailor materials for EC, MOS and other to meet the performance specifications. Costs could approach the benchmark of ≤ \$100 per sensor element. (Current EC and MOS sensor elements cost at least twice the target amount.) Recommendations for future sensor testing • Broaden the usefulness of the results by evaluating the performance of a larger selection of existing sensors, including GOTS and sensors in the research phase. This would provide stronger guidance for both sensor development and industry-wide monitoring of ACEQ. • Evaluate the performance of improved sensor materials and assess the performance of systems that become candidates for widespread use in aircraft. A body such as an ASHRAE committee of stakeholders and sensor developers could use LBNL’s protocol as a starting point for evaluating improved sensors. • Use LBNL’s protocols to screen sensor systems before more rigorous testing intended to overcome the limitations of this study. • Test sensor systems for cross-sensitivity to ozone, CO, then add VOC (toluene, terpenes) ethanol and halogen- containing species (pesticides and flame retardants). • Evaluate using CO/CO2 ratios to signal incidents caused by pyrolysis products. • Collaborate with aircraft engineers for in-flight testing of the best available sensor technologies.},

	abstract = {Objective To determine if a low-cost particle counter, the Dylos DC 1700, can be used in homes to quantify second-hand smoke (SHS) concentrations. Methods Participants were recruited from a hospital-based study of attitudes on smoking. Two photometric devices (Dylos DC1700 and Sidepak AM510 Personal Aerosol Monitor) capable of measuring and logging concentrations of particulate matter were placed in smoking and non-smoking homes for approximately 24h. Acquired data were randomly allocated to one of two groups: one was used to generate a calibration equation using regression techniques; the second was used for validation of the generated model. The mean difference and limits of agreement between the two instruments were calculated using the validation dataset. Summary air-quality results were also compared across the entire dataset. Results Over 500 001 minute concentration measurements were collected from 34 homes. 25 301 randomly selected paired-measurements were used to generate a calibration equation (R2 0.86) converting the particle number concentration from the Dylos to a mass concentration of PM2.5 as measured by the Sidepak. The mean difference (limits of agreement) between the remaining 25 102 paired measurements was −0.09 (−49.7 to 49.5) with 3.2\% of values outside the limits of agreement. Differences in the air quality information generated by the two instruments were generally small and unlikely to impact on user interpretation. Conclusions The Dylos appears to be a valid instrument for measuring PM2.5 in household settings. The Dylos may be useful in air quality-based interventions designed to change smokers’ behaviours with the possibility of encouraging cessation and/or smoke-free homes.},

	abstract = {Mobile monitoring is increasingly used as an additional tool to acquire air quality data at a high spatial resolution. However, given the high temporal variability of urban air quality, a limited number of mobile measurements may only represent a snapshot and not be representative. In this study, the impact of this temporal variability on the representativeness is investigated and a methodology to map urban air quality using mobile monitoring is developed and evaluated. A large set of black carbon (BC) measurements was collected in Antwerp, Belgium, using a bicycle equipped with a portable BC monitor (micro-aethalometer). The campaign consisted of 256 and 96 runs along two fixed routes (2 and 5 km long). Large gradients over short distances and differences up to a factor of 10 in mean BC concentrations aggregated at a resolution of 20 m are observed. Mapping at such a high resolution is possible, but a lot of repeated measurements are required. After computing a trimmed mean and applying background normalisation, depending on the location 24 to 94 repeated measurement runs (median of 41) are required to map the BC concentrations at a 50 m resolution with an uncertainty of 25 \%. When relaxing the uncertainty to 50 \%, these numbers reduce to 5 to 11 (median of 8) runs. We conclude that mobile monitoring is a suitable approach for mapping the urban air quality at a high spatial resolution, and can provide insight into the spatial variability that would not be possible with stationary monitors. A careful set-up is needed with a sufficient number of repetitions in relation to the desired reliability and spatial resolution. Specific data processing methods such as background normalisation and event detection have to be applied.},

We evaluated an Aeroqual Ltd. Series 500 semiconducting metal oxide O3 and an electrochemical NO2 sensor against UK national network reference analysers for more than 2 months at an urban background site in central Edinburgh. Hourly-average Aeroqual O3 sensor observations were highly correlated (R2 = 0.91) and of similar magnitude to observations from the UV-absorption reference O3 analyser. The Aeroqual NO2 sensor observations correlated poorly with the reference chemiluminescence NO2 analyser (R2 = 0.02), but the deviations between Aeroqual and reference analyser values ([NO2]Aeroq − [NO2]ref) were highly significantly correlated with concurrent Aeroqual O3 sensor observations [O3]Aeroq. This permitted effective linear calibration of the [NO2]Aeroq data, evaluated using ‘hold out’ subsets of the data (R2 ≥ 0.85). These field observations under temperate environmental conditions suggest that the Aeroqual Series 500 NO2 and O3 monitors have good potential to be useful ambient air monitoring instruments in urban environments provided that the O3 and NO2 gas sensors are calibrated against reference analysers and deployed in parallel.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel low-cost instrument that uses a sensor based on conductivity changes of heated tungstic oxide, which is capable of accurately measuring ambient concentrations of ozone. A combination of temperature steps and air flow-rate steps is used to continually reset and re-zero the sensor. A two-stage calibration procedure is presented, in which a nonlinear transformation converts sensor resistance to a signal linear in ozone concentration, then a linear correlation is used to align the calibration with a reference instrument. The required calibration functions specific for the sensor, and control system for air flow rate and sensor temperature, are housed with the sensor in a compact, simple-to-exchange assembly. The instrument can be operated on solar power and uses cell phone technology to enable monitoring in remote locations. Data from field trials are presented here to demonstrate that both the accuracy and the stability of the instrument over periods of months are within a few parts-per-billion by volume. We show that common failure modes can be detected through measurement of signals available from the instrument. The combination of long-term stability, self-diagnosis, and simple, inexpensive repair means that the cost of operation and calibration of the instruments is significantly reduced in comparison with traditional reference instrumentation. These instruments enable the economical construction and operation of ozone monitoring networks of accuracy, time resolution and spatial density sufficient to resolve the local gradients that are characteristic of urban air pollution.},

The IDAD-Institute of Environment and Development Air Quality Mobile Laboratory was placed at an urban traffic location in the city centre of Aveiro to conduct continuous measurements with standard equipment and reference analysers for CO, NOx, O3, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, solar radiation and precipitation. The comparison of the sensor data generated by different microsensor-systems installed side-by-side with reference analysers, contributes to the assessment of the performance and the accuracy of microsensor-systems in a real-world context, and supports their calibration and further development. The overall performance of the sensors in terms of their statistical metrics and measurement profile indicates significant differences in the results depending on the platform and on the sensors considered. In terms of pollutants, some promising results were observed for O3 (r2: 0.12–0.77), CO (r2: 0.53–0.87), and NO2 (r2: 0.02–0.89). For PM (r2: 0.07–0.36) and SO2 (r2: 0.09–0.20) the results show a poor performance with low correlation coefficients between the reference and microsensor measurements.

	abstract = {Background Particulate matter (PM) is a pollutant of high public interest regulated by national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) using federal reference method (FRM) and federal equivalent method (FEM) instrumentation identified for environmental monitoring. PM is present in the atmosphere in concentrations that can vary greatly according to location, temperature, and a number of circumstances that influence local air quality. Citizen scientists and other researchers have a desire to monitor this pollutant, and there is a need for increased accessibility to portable and economical monitoring and sampling equipment. The evolution of low cost PM sensors has resulted in a number of such instruments becoming commercially available. However, this evaluation was not conducted to assess the suitability of these PM sensors to serve as either FRM or FEM sampler instruments. This activity represents the first step in evaluating some of the commercially available low cost PM sensors and comparing their data-collection capabilities to that of collocated FEM samplers during field evaluations. Study Objectives As part of its Air Climate \& Energy (ACE) research program on emerging technologies (ACE EM-3), the US EPA developed a research effort with the goals of: conducting a world-wide market survey of low cost PM sensors ({\textbackslash}textless\$2500), acquiring such sensors, and then conducting collocated field evaluations of these sensors in direct comparison with FEM instrumentation. A total of eight such devices were obtained and sited in the established PM sensor test platform on the US EPA’s RTP, NC campus (AIRS). The collocated PM2.5 FEM instrumentation with 5-minute time resolution provided the means to investigate both short duration and daily (24-hr) comparisons between the test devices and the FEM response. Potential data confounders such as temperature and relative humidity were obtained to aid in the investigation. The relationship between FEM response and the various sensors was established in a regression. Ancillary findings related to ease of use, portability, data collection efficiency, among others, were established based upon our experiences over approximately one month of continuous operation. Study Approach Direct manufacturer contact, as well as internet searches, surfaced eight prospective low cost sensors meriting incorporation into this study. In some instances, sensor developers contacted the research team and expressed interest in having their device evaluated. Any device accepted under such conditions was incorporated without restrictions or direct involvement of the developer. Despite there being a large number of PM sensors on the market, many appeared to lack specific properties that discouraged us from incorporating them into the research. We focused on sensors that demonstrated direct reading, provided either true or estimated size cut point data (preferably PM2.5), and were responsive to at least some outdoor monitoring. Not xiii every sensor that was evaluated met these criteria. Recent sensor-related conferences hosted by EPA1 and other scientific exchanges (including peer review literature2,3) clearly indicated that PM sensors reporting only particle number (or counts) were both available at low cost and may prove comparable to more expensive light scattering (nephelometric) and direct mass measuring (Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance-TEOM) instrumentation. A number of these devices were secured and evaluated to meet the apparent growing use rate among both research professionals and citizen scientists. Concerning outdoor monitoring applications, only one of the sensors evaluated came fully weather protected, and allowances (shelters) were developed to protect the remaining devices. In several instances, the sensor developers expressed that their devices were primarily intended for indoor monitoring. Regardless of how a manufacturer defines the applicability of a given low cost PM sensor, it is highly likely that citizen scientists and others would try to use such devices to the greatest extent possible while perhaps ignoring cautions about primary siting requirements. Outdoor monitoring is a prime example of such a scenario, and was therefore fully assimilated into the study design. As a result, one might consider the performance characteristics defined in this report as potentially representing a worst-case scenario. Regardless, we protected all sensors from weather conditions (ambient temperature, moisture, stray light) to the best of our ability. For approximately one month, these collocated low cost sensors were cited on a PM monitor test platform with a Grimm Model EDM180 PM2.5 (EQPM-0311-195) FEM on the US EPA’s RTP, NC campus. The units operated continuously during this time with the exception of data recovery, flow checks/calibration, and general servicing as required by the various manufacturers. Once the monitoring period was completed, data from the FEM, sensors and meteorological findings were compared to determine how these variables influence low cost sensor response. Sensor Performance Results Discreet statistical evaluation of sensor performance was established with respect to collocated data associated with the Grimm FEM. When possible, resulting regression characteristics were optimized with respect to data normalization and influence of confounders. 1 EPA Air Sensors Workshop, 2014.

Changing the paradigm for air pollution monitoring. Environmental Science and Technology, 47: 11369-11377 (2013). xiv Ease of Use Features Evaluation Concerning ease of use features, several key findings were evident. In general, these included, but were not limited to:  Power Requirements: None of the units tested had the ability to operate for extensive (multi-day) periods without electrical assistance. Since our goal was to obtain as much collocated data as possible, we purposefully removed such a variable (battery life) from the research. That being said, certain sensors required specific power supplies (such as a USB computer connection), while others simply required a ‘step-down’ 115V transformer. Upon battery power alone, the sensors would expect to operate from 8 hours to 3 days, depending upon sensor type.  Data collection/transmission/storage/recovery: There were numerous data collection/transmission/storage/recovery approaches observed between the various sensor devices. Therefore, extensive efforts had to be performed to ensure data recovery to perform the evaluations. Cellular communication, WiFi hot spots, direct storage via laptops, or electronic tablet connections had to be established, developed, or in some cases unexpectedly refined as to the manufacturer’s suggested protocols. Data communication issues had to be fully vetted to ensure both consistent and reliable data recovery.  Data Schemes: Data schemas were widely variable between the sensors evaluated. This lack of standardization across manufacturers and the often-unique pattern of their data formatting (and the types of data being reported) made data recovery and insertion into statistical analysis schema somewhat difficult. Individual data recovery programs often had to be established for each sensor so that data could be recovered. In some instances, communication with the developer was necessary to understand what their output was so that we could correctly identify variables for analysis.  Installation and WiFi considerations: Almost all of the low cost sensors were easy to install following our development of weather-shielded assemblies. Their low mass and small sizes were highly advantageous for siting. Even so, all of the units had to have external power supplies. Some of the sensors required direct computer connections, which in our opinion minimizes its capabilities relative to outdoor use. Even so, it should be recognized that manufacturers are not necessarily trying to market these as outdoor-worthy PM samplers. It cannot be underestimated that when used outdoors, establishment of data communication can be difficult, especially if cellular communication or a local WiFi hot spot is required. In our situation, we were able to establish a local WiFi hot spot or other needed communication requirements. We sometimes had to work directly with a manufacturer to develop digital data storage internal to the unit or via other means such as transferrable data storage card when necessary to ensure sufficient data recovery for our purpose. Sensor Performance Characteristics With rare exception, most of the low cost PM sensors demonstrated an ability to provide at least some short duration response variability (some on the order of 1 second). Data clearly indicated that time weighted averages of approximately one to 5 minutes are more acceptable when it came to end users being able to understand the general response encountered by the simple noise of the instrument itself. xv  Precision: Only the MicroPEM was evaluated for precision capabilities. Three collocated sensors were operated for a period of approximately one month and their general inter-variability established.  Linearity: The sensors typically provided coefficient of determination (R2) in comparison with FEM measures of {\textbackslash}textless 0.8. In a number of situations, there was little or no statistical agreement (R2 {\textbackslash}textless 0.1). Estimates of either particle count or algorithm-based mass concentrations (μg/m3) were equally capable of reasonable FEM agreement or equal lack of agreement. Since all algorithm-based mass concentration estimates are only as good as the base light scattering determination itself, it would appear that much of the lack of agreement probably lies with the latter. As established by the design of the field studies reported here, a reasonable estimation of mass concentration from particle counts could have been established for one of the sensors (Dylos DC1100).  Relative Humidity and Temperature Changes: There was wide disparity in the response of individual sensors to extremes of either RH or temperature challenge. Both minimal impacts as well as extreme impacts were observed as they relate to the sensors successfully reporting the challenge concentrations as environmental conditions changed. Some of this was expected due to the very nature of the sensing mechanism (approach) often employed in low cost sensors. Considering that all of the sensors tested were based upon light scattering principles where particle hydroscopic properties are known to be an influencing factor in mass concentration estimation, it is uncertain why such a wide range in RH influence (as noted by R2 relationships) were obtained. Likewise, some sensors were highly collinear with respect to changes in outdoor temperature while others showed no such relationship.  Response Range: Response range of the sensors varied widely. It was not unusual to see multiple order of magnitude differences between sensors and the concentrations they were reporting. It should be clearly stated here that environmental impacts of relative humidity and temperature are often a significant influence in sensor response (light scattering). RH was not accounted for with sensor algorithms, with only one exception (MicroPEM), and therefore a widespread variety of responses with changing meteorological conditions was to be expected. Light scattering optics, cell geometry, and other key engineering features are known to be highly influential relative to nephelometric response and therefore the variability observed here in the findings reflects not only the physics of light scattering devices in general, but also how such features have or have not been incorporated into these low cost devices. Conclusions While both the discreet performance characteristics and ease of use characteristics for each device were highly variable, some of the devices appeared to provide reasonable agreement with the collocated FEM mass concentration estimates. The frequent lack of agreement between the sensor and the FEM is a clear indication that citizen scientists and others employing such devices (especially under outdoor monitoring conditions) must remain aware of the uncertainty surrounding the data being generated. At times, meteorological conditions (temperature, RH) had a significant impact upon low cost sensor responses and it was necessary to remove some data to improve the performance statistics. It should be noted that the end users of these devices need to understand where data exclusion might be necessary, as often little or no instructions on such xvi matters are clearly defined by the sensor manufacturers. It would appear that collocation in the general test area would provide a reasonable approach for end users to ascertain the ability of a low cost sensor to be provide useable data. The information provided in this report represents a first step towards ensuring that the next generation of low cost air quality sensors has even more capabilities, meeting a wide variety of air quality monitoring needs. The study also provides potential low cost sensor users with key information regarding sensor performance and the criteria that must be addressed in order to collect data successfully.},

	abstract = {This report summarizes the results of low cost air quality sensor performance trials conducted in the NERL’s on-site laboratories located in Research Triangle Park, NC during 2012-2013. Such trials were viewed as highly valuable for all parties following the conclusion of the U.S. EPA’s Air Sensor and APPs conference conducted in the spring of 2012. Conference attendees from a wide range of interests (government, sensor development, citizen scientists, etc) concluded that basic sensor performance characteristics of available sensor technologies were unknown. Many potential users of these technologies were unaware that data quality needed to be established or how one might perform such determinations. Many conference attendees shared that the U.S. EPA needed to take a leadership role to both educate sensor developers and end users about needed performance standards, share technical information about how one would establish such characteristics, and foster continuing dialogue between all interested parties on this subject matter. As a result of the aforementioned conclusion, the U.S. EPA initiated a research program in the summer of 2012 to survey sensor developers about potential technology-sharing with the ultimate goal of conducting exhaustive laboratory-based sensor performance trials. Collaborating institutions responded to an open, web-based invitation to submit applications to participate. Applicant screening was performed that ensured the sensors being offered for evaluation were available to others for use and that they had not been previously examined via any third-party laboratory. In addition, there had to be a lack of publically-available information on sensor performance for inclusion in the research. A total of nine institutions of multi-national origin agreed to establish confidential MCRADA research with the U.S. EPA associated with the performance of O 3 and NO 2 gas phase air quality sensors. These sensor types were selected due to their prevalence in the market place and the availability of established test regimens that might be applied. Findings associated with sensors shared by seven of these parties are described in this report and are being voluntarily shared here by the collaborating institutions. These institutions were a combination of academic, private sector, and non-profit organizations that had responded to the open challenge of participating in exhaustive laboratory-based trials of basic sensor performance characteristics. Performance traits such as response linearity, response reaction times, detection limit, and response to interfering agents, among others were established. In addition, characteristics important to potential users such as battery life, ease of operation, data storage and/or communication protocols were investigated. Laboratory data were collected using an exposure chamber linked with either Federal Reference Method (FRM) or Federal Equivalent Method (FEM) instrumentation. Sensors were individually challenged using a variety of test conditions and their resulting response recorded. Replicate trials of each challenge were performed to provide needed statistical strength in establishing performance. Select findings from these trials are as follows: (1) Many of these sensors, having commercial values of {\textbackslash}textless \$1000, demonstrate some performance characteristics that often rival those of FRM/FEM instrumentation. The sensors often exhibited very fast response times with minimal rise and lag times which suggests potential use for continuous or near-continuous environmental monitoring. (2) Many of the sensors had a high degree of linearity over their full response range at concentrations often well above normally observed environmental concentrations. (3) While the sensors often did not have the detection limits as low as FRM/FEM instrumentation, they often achieved levels near these concentrations that would appear to meet a wide variety of environmentally-relevant monitoring needs. (4) Some of the sensors revealed some unwanted co-response to interfering agents (e.g., NO 2 , O 3 , SO 2 ). Likewise, extremes of RH and temperature often resulted in some undesirable response characteristics. (5) Establishment of data collection/recovery protocols involved a wide array of approaches to achieve success (e.g., WiFi hot spots, cellular telephone, SD card, proprietary web data portals). This often involved iterative upgrades to communication protocols, hardware and other integrated systems as testing was initiated on each device.},

	abstract = {Measurements at appropriate spatial and temporal scales are essential for understanding and monitoring spatially heterogeneous environments with complex and highly variable emission sources, such as in urban areas. However, the costs and complexity of conventional air quality measurement methods means that measurement networks are generally extremely sparse. In this paper we show that miniature, low-cost electrochemical gas sensors, traditionally used for sensing at parts-per-million (ppm) mixing ratios can, when suitably configured and operated, be used for parts-per-billion (ppb) level studies for gases relevant to urban air quality. Sensor nodes, in this case consisting of multiple individual electrochemical sensors, can be low-cost and highly portable, thus allowing the deployment of scalable high-density air quality sensor networks at fine spatial and temporal scales, and in both static and mobile configurations. In this paper we provide evidence for the performance of electrochemical sensors at the parts-per-billion level, and then outline results obtained from deployments of networks of sensor nodes in both an autonomous, high-density, static network in the wider Cambridge (UK) area, and as mobile networks for quantification of personal exposure. Examples are presented of measurements obtained with both highly portable devices held by pedestrians and cyclists, and static devices attached to street furniture. The widely varying mixing ratios reported by this study confirm that the urban environment cannot be fully characterised using sparse, static networks, and that measurement networks with higher resolution (both spatially and temporally) are required to quantify air quality at the scales which are present in the urban environment. We conclude that the instruments described here, and the low-cost/high-density measurement philosophy which underpins it, have the potential to provide a far more complete assessment of the high-granularity air quality structure generally observed in the urban environment, and could ultimately be used for quantification of human exposure as well as for monitoring and legislative purposes.},

This method is generally more successful than the calibration in exposure chambers under controlled conditions because of the difference between laboratory and fields air matrixes. To expand this result, we carried out an experiment at two sampling sites. At the first site, the microsensors were calibrated during a few days. Subsequently, the calibrated microsensors were taken to another sampling site where the effectiveness of the calibration function of the first site was evaluated. The trend of the differences between UV photometry and microsensors were analyzed to evidence possible drift of the microsensors over time. The correlation of these differences with meteorological data was investigated to evidence possible interference and to propose new calibration methods.},

	abstract = {Accurate monitoring of indoor mass concentrations of particulate matter is very important for health risk assessment as people in developed countries spend approximately 90\% of their time indoors. The direct reading, aerosol monitoring device, Turnkey, OSIRIS Particle Monitor (Model 2315) and the European reference low volume sampler, LVS3 (Sven/Leckel LVS3) with size-selective inlets for PM10 and PM2.5 fractions were used to assess the comparability of available optical and gravimetric methods for particulate matter characterization in indoor air. Simultaneous 24-hour samples were collected in an indoor environment for 60 sampling periods in the town of Bor, Serbia. The 24-hour mean PM10 levels from the OSIRIS monitor were well correlated with the LVS3 levels (R2 ¼ 0.87) and did not show statistically signiﬁcant bias. The 24-hour mean PM2.5 levels from the OSIRIS monitor were moderately correlated with the LVS3 levels (R2 ¼ 0.71), but show statistically signiﬁcant bias. The results suggest that the OSIRIS monitor provides sufﬁciently accurate measurements for PM10. The OSIRIS monitor underestimated the indoor PM10 concentrations by approximately 12\%, relative to the reference LVS3 sampler. The accuracy of PM10 measurements could be further improved through empirical adjustment. For the ﬁne fraction of particulate matter, PM2.5, it was found that the OSIRIS monitor underestimated indoor concentrations by approximately 63\%, relative to the reference LVS3 sampler. This could lead to exposure misclassiﬁcation in health effects studies relying on PM2.5 measurements collected with this instrument in indoor environments.},

New application opportunities appeared together with new challenges due to limitations in dealing with rapid pollutants concentrations transients both for static and mobile deployments.

DNN architectures have been devised and tested in order to tackle the cross sensitivities issues and sensors inherent dynamic limitations. Testing have been performed using an on-field recorded dataset from a pervasive deployment in Cambridge (UK), encompassing several weeks. The results obtained with the dynamic model are compared with the response of the static neural network and the performance analysis indicates the capability of the on-field dynamic multivariate calibration to ameliorate the static calibration approach performance in this real world air quality monitoring scenario. Interestingly, results analysis also suggests that the improvements are more significant when pollutants concentration changes more rapidly.},

Sensors for CO, CO2, NO2, O3, VOC, PM2.5 and PM10 were integrated on an Arduino Shield compatible board. As concerns PM2.5 and PM10 sensors, the station underwent a laboratory calibration and later a ﬁeld validation. Laboratory calibration has been carried out at the headquarters of CNR-IBIMET in Florence (Italy) against a TSI DustTrak reference instrument. A MATLAB procedure, implementing advanced mathematical techniques to detect possible complex non-linear relationships between sensor signals and reference data, has been developed and implemented to accomplish the laboratory calibration. Field validation has been performed across a full “heating season” (1 November 2016 to 15 April 2017) by co-locating the station at a road site in Florence where an ofﬁcial ﬁxed air quality station was in operation. Both calibration and validation processes returned ﬁne scores, in most cases better than those achieved for similar systems in the literature. During ﬁeld validation, in particular, for PM2.5 and PM10 mean biases of 0.036 and 0.598 µg/m3, RMSE of 4.056 and 6.084 µg/m3, and R2 of 0.909 and 0.957 were achieved, respectively. Robustness of the developed station, seamless deployed through a ﬁve and a half month outdoor campaign without registering sensor failures or drifts, is a further key point.},

The aim of the LIFE PHOTOSCALING Project (LPP) is to assess the effectiveness of different photocatalytic pavements in reducing NO2 pollution. The objective of this preliminary study is to determine how well low cost AQmesh sensors can accurately enough measure NO2 concentrations to be able to determine the effects of using photocatalytic pavements. Data was collected from AQmesh sensors that were installed in two Air Quality Stations in order to monitor NO2 under trafﬁc and urban background conditions. The NO2 measurements were unreliable, resulting in an unsatisfactory level of accuracy. A two-step calibration method was devised in order to overcome this limitation. This method consisted of supervised statistical machine learning regression algorithms. A ﬁrst Multivariate Linear Regression provided a new explanatory variable that contained valuable information about the error. This variable was fed into more sophisticated equations, such as Random Forests, Support Vector Machines and Artiﬁcial Neural Networks. The various models were evaluated by calculating statistics of errors and relative expanded uncertainties, and through Taylor Diagrams. After a careful calibration, AQmesh sensors met the Air Quality Directive’s standards of accuracy at high concentrations of NO2. However, we found that each individual sensor behaves differently and thus, each unit requires the development and application of a speciﬁc calibration model.},

These portable low-cost monitors can be used to characterize PM concentrations with high spatial and temporal resolution. This study evaluates the performance of four low-cost PM monitors (Speck, Dylos, TSI AirAssure, and UB AirSense) against well-characterized reference instruments, and studies their suitability for PM ﬁeld exposure studies. The low-cost monitors were characterized in a room-sized laboratory chamber with standard relative humidity and temperature conditions, with two PM sources: cigarette smoke and Arizona Test Dust. This study found that any of the monitors tested perform with adequate precision for monitoring air quality in an indoor microenvironment, although the ﬁeld calibration of the monitor with a standard instrument for speciﬁc types of particles would be required. Other factors such as ﬂexibility in data download methods, connectivity, compatibility with environmental conditions, and quality of technical support should also be considered when selecting low-cost PM monitors for human inhalation exposure assessment studies.},

	abstract = {Low-cost sensors are effective for measuring the mass concentration of ambient aerosols and second-hand smoke in homes, but their use at concentrations relevant to occupational settings has not been demonstrated. We measured the concentrations of four aerosols (salt, Arizona road dust, welding fume, and diesel exhaust) with three types of low-cost sensors (a DC1700 from Dylos and two commodity sensors from Sharp), an aerosol photometer, and reference instruments at concentrations up to 6500 mg/m3. Raw output was used to assess sensor precision and develop equations to compute mass concentrations. EPA and NIOSH protocols were used to assess the mass concentrations estimated with low-cost sensors compared to reference instruments. The detection efﬁciency of the DC1700 ranged from 0.04\% at 0.1 mm to 108\% at 5 mm, as expected, although misclassiﬁcation of ﬁne and coarse particles was observed. The raw output of the DC1700 had higher precision (lower coefﬁcient of variation, CV D 7.4\%) than that of the two sharp devices (CV D 25\% and 17\%), a ﬁnding attributed to differences in manufacturer calibration. Aerosol type strongly inﬂuenced sensor response, indicating the need for on-site calibration to convert sensor output to mass concentration. Once calibrated, however, the mass concentration estimated with low-cost sensors was highly correlated with that of reference instruments (R2D 0.99). These results suggest that the DC1700 and Sharp sensors are useful in estimating aerosol mass concentration for aerosols at concentrations relevant to the workplace.},

The development and evaluation of more portable and affordable monitoring instruments based on low-cost sensors may offer a means to supplement and extend existing infrastructure, increasing the density and coverage of empirical measurements and thereby improving exposure science and control. Here, we report on ﬁeld calibrations of a custom-built, battery-operated aerosol monitoring instrument we developed using low-cost, off-the-shelf optical aerosol sensors. We calibrated our instruments using 1 h and 24 h PM2.5 data from a class III US EPA Federal Equivalent Method (FEM) PM2.5 β-attenuation monitor in continuous operation at a regulatory monitoring site in Oakland, California. We observed negligible associations with ambient humidity and temperature; linear corrections were sufﬁcient to explain 60 \% of the variance in 1 h reference PM2.5 data and 72 \% of the variance in 24 h data. Performance at 1 h integration times was comparable to commercially available optical instruments costing considerably more. These ﬁndings warrant further exploration of the circumstances under which this class of aerosol sensors may proﬁtably be deployed to generate improved PM2.5 data sets.},

	abstract = {Objective Finely resolved PM2.5 exposure measurements at the level of individual participants or over a targeted geographic area can be challenging due to the cost, size and weight of the monitoring equipment. We propose re-purposing the low-cost, portable and lightweight Shinyei PPD42NS particle counter as a particle counting device. Previous field deployment of this sensor suggests that it captures trends in ambient PM2.5 concentrations, but important characteristics of the sensor response have yet to be determined. Laboratory testing was undertaken in order to characterize performance. Methods The Shinyei sensors, in-line with a TSI Aerosol Particle Sizer (APS) model 3321, tracked particle decay within an aerosol exposure chamber. Test atmospheres were composed of monodisperse polystyrene spheres with diameters of 0.75, 1, 2 3 and 6 um as well as a polydisperse atmosphere of ASHRAE test dust \#1. Results Two-minute block averages of the sensor response provide a measurement with low random error, within sensor, for particles in the 0.75–6μm range with a limit of detection of 1 μg/ m3. The response slope of the sensors is idiomatic, and each sensor requires a unique response curve. A linear model captures the sensor response for concentrations below 50 μg/m3 and for concentrations above 50 μg/m3 a non-linear function captures the response and saturates at 800 μg/m3. The Limit of Detection (LOD) is 1 μg/m3. The response time is on the order of minutes, making it appropriate for tracking short-term changes in concentration. Conclusions When paired with prior evaluation, these sensors are appropriate for use as ambient particle counters for low and medium concentrations of respirable particles ({\textbackslash}textless 100 ug/m3).

	abstract = {Low-cost, light-scattering-based particulate matter (PM) sensors are becoming more widely available and are being increasingly deployed in ambient and indoor environments because of their low cost and ability to provide high spatial and temporal resolution PM information. Researchers have begun to evaluate some of these sensors under laboratory and environmental conditions. In this study, a low-cost, particulate matter sensor (Plantower PMS 1003/3003) used by a community air-quality network is evaluated in a controlled wind-tunnel environment and in the ambient environment during several winter-time, cold-pool events that are associated with high ambient levels of PM. In the wind-tunnel, the PMS sensor performance is compared to two research-grade, light-scattering instruments, and in the ambient tests, the sensor performance is compared to two federal equivalent (one tapered element oscillating microbalance and one beta attenuation monitor) and gravimetric federal reference methods (FEMs/FRMs) as well as one research-grade instrument (GRIMM). The PMS sensor response correlates well with research-grade instruments in the wind-tunnel tests, and its response is linear over the concentration range tested (200–850 μg/m3). In the ambient tests, this PM sensor correlates better with gravimetric methods than previous studies with correlation coefficients of 0.88. However additional measurements under a variety of ambient conditions are needed. Although the PMS sensor correlated as well as the research-grade instrument to the FRM/FEMs in ambient conditions, its response varies with particle properties to a much greater degree than the research-grade instrument. In addition, the PMS sensors overestimate ambient PM concentrations and begin to exhibit a non-linear response when PM2.5 concentrations exceed 40 μg/m3. These results have important implications for communicating results from low-cost sensor networks, and they highlight the importance of using an appropriate correction factor for the target environmental conditions if the user wants to compare the results to FEM/FRMs.},

Pearson correlation coefficients were often moderate ({\textbackslash}textasciitilde50\% of units showed correlations {\textbackslash}textgreater0.5 during the first season), indicating that there was some coherent variation across the area, likely driven by a combination of meteorological conditions (wind speed, direction, and mixed layer heights) and the concentration of PM2.5 being transported into the region.

The limit of detection of the monitors was calculated, and the monitors’ bias and precision, as well as the results’ reproducibility, were determined. Correlation coefficients of 0.3 and 0.2 observed between the Speck units and the Grimm instrument during indoor and outdoor measurements were increased by separating the data into sets affected by different sources. When the ambient data were divided into combustion and non-combustion aerosol, the mean r2 increased to 0.5 and 0.4 for indoor and outdoor combustion periods data, respectively. Also, averaging the data to improve the signal to noise ratio increases the correlation for low PM concentrations. For outdoor data, the correlation increased to 0.5 when the data were averaged to hourly averages. Between the Specks, the correlation was {\textbackslash}textgreater0.9 indoors, showing a high degree of reproducibility among the results. The limit of detection was calculated using the method of Wallace et al. (2011) and was found to be 10µgm−3 at a 99\% confidence level for 1-minute data. The mean bias values showed a PM overestimation of 200\% for indoor data, and 500\% for outdoor data relative to the Grimm values. However, these values are influenced by the low measured PM concentrations. The RMSE of Specks was about 10µgm−3 and the concentrations were often about this value. The overall precision was 8.8±1.7\% indoors and 12.2±6.2\% outdoors, suggesting its independence from changing ambient conditions. The Speck monitors may be suitable for use in indoor and outdoor PM monitoring programs, depending on the required performance to meet the goals of the study. The instrument has a large bias at low concentrations, making it unsuitable for background measurements or for measurements in clean environments. Even at concentrations over the LOD, it is necessary to assess the bias for expected particle sources before any instrument deployment.},

Owing to increased interest in assessing personal and community exposures to PM, we evaluated the feasibility of employing a low-cost portable directreading instrument for measurement of ambient air PM exposure. A Dylos DC 1700 PM sensor was collocated with a Grimm 11-R in an urban residential area of Houston Texas. The 1-min averages of particle number concentrations for sizes between 0.5 and 2.5 µm (small size) and sizes larger than 2.5 µm (large size) from a DC 1700 were compared with the 1-min averages of PM2.5 (aerodynamic size less than 2.5 µm) and coarse PM (aerodynamic size between 2.5 and 10 µm) concentrations from a Grimm 11-R. We used a linear regression equation to convert DC 1700 number concentrations to mass concentrations, utilizing measurements from the Grimm 11-R. The estimated average DC 1700 PM2.5 concentration (13.2 ± 13.7 µg/m3) was similar to the average measured Grimm 11-R PM2.5 concentration (11.3 ± 15.1 µg/m3). The overall correlation (r2) for PM2.5 between the DC 1700 and Grimm 11-R was 0.778. The estimated average coarse PM concentration from the DC 1700 (5.6 ± 12.1 µg/m3) was also similar to that measured with the Grimm 11-R (4.8 ± 16.5 µg/m3) with an r2 of 0.481. The effects of relative humidity and particle size on the association between the DC 1700 and the Grimm 11-R results were also examined. The calculated PM mass concentrations from the DC 1700 were close to those measured with the Grimm 11-R when relative humidity was less than 60\% for both PM2.5 and coarse PM. Particle size distribution was more important for the association of coarse PM between the DC 1700 and Grimm 11-R than it was for PM2.5.},

Our team has been engaged in the development of low-cost, wearable, air quality monitors (M-Pods) using the Arduino platform. These M-Pods house two types of sensors – commercially available metal oxide semiconductor (MOx) sensors used to measure CO, O3, NO2, and total VOCs, and NDIR sensors used to measure CO2. The MOx sensors are low in cost and show high sensitivity near ambient levels; however they display non-linear output signals and have cross-sensitivity effects. Thus, a quantiﬁcation system was developed to convert the MOx sensor signals into concentrations.},

A cluster of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen monoxide, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide sensors was operated. The sensors were either of metal oxide or electrochemical type or based on miniaturized infra-red cell. For each method, a twoweek calibration was carried out at a semi-rural site against reference measurements. Subsequently, the accuracy of the predicted values was evaluated for about ﬁve months using a few indicators and techniques: orthogonal regression, target diagram, measurement uncertainty and drifts over time of sensor predictions. The study assessed if the sensors were could reach the Data Quality Objective (DQOs) of the European Air Quality Directive for indicative methods (between 25 and 30\% of uncertainty for O3 and NO2). In this study it appears that O3 may be calibrated using simple regression techniques while for NO2 a better agreement between sensors and reference measurements was reached using supervised learning techniques. The hourly O3 DQO was met while it was unlikely that NO2 hourly one could be met. This was likely caused by the low NO2 levels correlated with high O3 levels that are typical of semi-rural site where the measurements of this study took place.},

However, the data quality from such systems has not been fully characterized and may not meet user expectations in research and regulatory uses, or for use in citizen science. In our study, electrochemical sensors (Alphasense B4 series) for carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and oxidants (Ox) were evaluated under controlled laboratory conditions to identify the inﬂuencing factors and quantify their relation with sensor outputs. Based on the laboratory tests, we developed different correction methods to compensate for the impact of ambient conditions. Further, the sensors were assembled into a monitoring system and tested in ambient conditions in Hong Kong side-by-side with regulatory reference monitors, and data from these tests were used to evaluate the performance of the models, to reﬁne them, and validate their applicability in variable ambient conditions in the ﬁeld. The more comprehensive correction models demonstrated enhanced performance when compared with uncorrected data. One over-arching observation of this study is that the low-cost sensors may promise excellent sensitivity and performance, but it is essential for users to understand and account for several key factors that may strongly affect the nature of sensor data. In this paper, we also evaluated factors of multi-month stability, temperature, and humidity, and considered the interaction of oxidant gases NO2 and ozone on a newly introduced oxidant sensor.},

	abstract = {Development of an air quality monitoring network with high spatio-temporal resolution requires installation of a large number of air pollutant monitors. However, state-of-the-art monitors are costly and may not be compatible with wireless data logging systems. In this study, low-cost electro-chemical sensors manufactured by Alphasense Ltd. for detection of CO and oxidative gases (predominantly O3 and NO2) were evaluated. The voltages from three oxidative gas sensors and three CO sensors were recorded every 2.5 sec when exposed to controlled gas concentrations in a 0.125-m3 acrylic glass chamber. Electro-chemical sensors for detection of oxidative gases demonstrated sensitivity to both NO2 and O3 with similar voltages recorded when exposed to equivalent environmental concentrations of NO2 or O3 gases, when evaluated separately. There was a strong linear relationship between the recorded voltages and target concentrations of oxidative gases (R2 {\textbackslash}textgreater 0.98) over a wide range of concentrations. Although a strong linear relationship was also observed for CO concentrations below 12 ppm, a saturation effect was observed wherein the voltage only changes minimally for higher CO concentrations (12–50 ppm). The nonlinear behavior of the CO sensors implied their unsuitability for environments where high CO concentrations are expected. Using a manufacturer-supplied shroud, sensors were tested at 2 different flow rates (0.25 and 0.5 Lpm) to mimic field calibration of the sensors with zero air and a span gas concentration (2 ppm NO2 or 15 ppm CO). As with all electrochemical sensors, the tested devices were subject to drift with a bias up to 20\% after 9 months of continuous operation. Alphasense CO sensors were found to be a proper choice for occupational and environmental CO monitoring with maximum concentration of 12 ppm, especially due to the field-ready calibration capability. Alphasense oxidative gas sensors are usable only if it is valuable to know the sum of the NO2 and O3 concentrations.},

Filter-based methods cannot measure this short-term variation of PM levels, which can be quite signiﬁcant considering human activity patterns. The goal of this study was to evaluate the active-ﬂow personal DataRAM for PM2.5 (MIE pDR-1200; Thermo Electron Corp., Franklin, MA) designed as a wearable monitor to continuously measure particle exposure. The instrument precision was found to be good (2.1\%) and signiﬁcantly higher than the passive pDR conﬁguration tested previously. A comparison to other proven continuous monitors resulted in good agreement at low relative humidities. Results at higher humidity followed predictable trends and provided a correction scheme that improved the accuracy of pDR readings. The pDR response to particle size also corresponded to previously observed and theoretical errors. The active ﬂow feature of the pDR allows collection of the sampled particles on a back-up ﬁlter. The 24-h mass measured on this ﬁlter was found to compare very well with a Federal Reference Method for PM2.5 mass.},

During outdoor activity, many people have to face the effects of particle pollution in the atmosphere. This is the main cause for respiratory health defects, such as heart, vascular, stroke and lung disease. In order to protect and prevent people from the particle matter area, this research shows the step of implementing the mobile application sensor, while checking sensitivity when it is connected. Using this existing low cost SDS011 sensor with CE, RoHS and FCC standard and testing mobility detects PM10 and PM2.5 value. Moreover, this research plots linear regression graphs to present the trend of the PM that is parallel with the x-axis. This illustration shows the promising performance of the sensor application after only a short period of time collecting data. Not only is this device more convenient than the bigger model due to its small size, but its ability to connect to an app on smart phones makes it ubiquitous. Moreover, we look forward to our future work where multiple devices can be placed next each other in the same areas. This will lead us to make an accurate quarantine area of the air pollution problem. Furthermore, this data can be used in forecasting combined with respiratory, cardiovascular or related diseases.},

Instruments were tested during 20 monitoring sessions that were subdivided in two different seasons to evaluate the performance of sensors across various environmental and meteorological conditions. Measurements were performed at an urban background site in Como, Italy. To evaluate the performance of the instruments, different analyses were conducted on 8-h averaged PM2.5 concentrations for comparison between direct-reading monitors and the gravimetric method, and minute-averaged data for comparison between the direct-reading instruments. A linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate whether the two measurement methods, when compared, could be considered comparable and/or mutually predictive. Further, Bland-Altman plots were used to determine whether the methods were characterized by speciﬁc biases. Finally, the correlations between the error associated with the direct-reading instruments and the meteorological parameters acquired at the sampling point were investigated. Principal results show a moderate degree of agreement between MMs and the reference method and a bias that increased with an increase in PM2.5 concentrations.},

Although several sensor systems have appeared the last years, generally developers cannot tackle the whole set of open problems regarding their use and the accuracy of the information they provide.

Unfortunately, a great deal of effort is wasted by repeating the same research by several private companies/public institutes or within several European projects. Moreover, when a technological solution is found, it is generally subjected to confidentiality aspects of the intellectual property right. In order to facilitate the use of sensors by diminishing the operational and development costs, the Joint Research Centre is developing a multi-sensor platform, called AirSensEUR, for the monitoring of air pollution at low concentration levels.

	abstract = {Recent studies have shown that (three-electrode) electrochemical sensors can be utilised for air quality monitoring and exposure assessment. The long-term performance of these sensors is however, often limited by the effects of ambient meteorological parameters on the sensor baseline, in particular temperature. If electrochemical (EC) sensors are to be adopted for air quality measurement over extended periods (months), this effect must be accounted for. Recent long-term, ambient measurements of CO, NO and NO2 using EC sensors have revealed that temperature (and relative humidity (RH)) had an effect on the baseline which was more pronounced in the case of NO sensors with coefficient of determination, R2 of 0.9 when compared to CO and NO2 with R2 {\textless} 0.2. In this paper we present a correction methodology that quantifies this effect (referred to here as fitted baseline), implementing these correction on the EC measurements. We found that EC sensors corrected for baseline-temperature effect using the method describe in this paper show good agreement when compared with traditional reference instrument. The coefficient of determination R2 of 0.7–0.8 and gradient of 0.9 was observed for baseline-temperature corrected NO compared to R2 = 0.02 prior to baseline-temperature correction. Furthermore, the correction methodology was validated by comparing the temperature-baseline with proxy temperature compensating measurements obtained from the fourth electrode of a set of novel four-electrode electrochemical sensors. A good agreement (R2 = 0.9, with gradients = 0.7–1.08 for NO and 0.5 {\textless} R2 {\textless} 0.73 for CO) was observed between temperature fitted baselines and outputs from the fourth electrodes (also known non-sensing/auxiliary electrode). Meanwhile, the long-term stability (calibrated signal output) of temperature-corrected data was evaluated by comparing the change in sensor gain to meteorological parameters including temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and wind direction. The results showed that there was no statistically significant change in sensitivity (two-sided t-test, p = 0.34) of the temperature-corrected electrochemical sensor with respect to these parameters (over several months). This work demonstrates that using the baseline-temperature correction methodology described in this paper, electrochemical sensors can be used for long-term (months), quantitative measurements of air quality gases at the parts per billion volume (ppb) mixing ratio level typical of ambient conditions in the urban environment.},

We propose two novel approaches for estimating the targeted pollutant level at desired time-location pairs, extending also to areas of the city that are beyond the coverage of our mobile sensor network. The first is a log-linear regression model which is built over a virtual dependency graph based on land-use data. The second is a deep learning framework that automatically captures the dependencies of the data based on autoencoders. We have evaluated the two proposed approaches against three canonical modeling techniques considering metrics of coefficient of determination (R²), root mean square error (RMSE), and the fraction of predictions within a factor of two of observations (FAC2). Using more than 45 million real measurements in the models, the results show consistently superior performance in respect to the canonical techniques.},

Notwithstanding their behaviour, performance and reliability are not yet fully investigated and understood. In the present study we investigate the medium term performance of a set of NO and NO$_{\textrm{2}}$ electrochemical sensors in Switzerland using three different regression algorithms within a field calibration approach. In order to mimic a realistic application of these devices, the sensors were initially co-located at a rural regulatory monitoring site for a 4-month calibration period, and subsequently deployed for 4 months at two distant regulatory urban sites in traffic and urban background conditions, where the performance of the calibration algorithms was explored. The applied algorithms were Multivariate Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression and Random Forest; these were tested, along with the sensors, in terms of generalisability, selectivity, drift, uncertainty, bias, noise and suitability for spatial mapping intra-urban pollution gradients with hourly resolution. Results from the deployment at the urban sites show a better performance of the non-linear algorithms (Support Vector Regression and Random Forest) achieving RMSE \&lt; {\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}5{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}ppb, \textit{R}$^{\textrm{2}}$ between 0.74 and 0.95 and MAE between 2 and 4{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}ppb. The combined use of both NO and NO$_{\textrm{2}}$ sensor output in the estimate of each pollutant showed some contribution by NO sensor to NO$_{\textrm{2}}$ estimate and vice-versa. All algorithms exhibited a drift ranging between 5 and 10{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}ppb for Random Forest and 15{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}ppb for Multivariate Linear Regression at the end of the deployment. The lowest concentration correctly estimated, with a 25{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\% relative expanded uncertainty, resulted in ca. 15\&ndash;20{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}ppb and was provided by the non-linear algorithms. As an assessment for the suitability of the tested sensors for a targeted application, the probability of resolving hourly concentration difference in cities was investigated.

The findings of this study, although derived from a specific sensor type and sensor model, are based on a flexible methodology and have extensive potential for exploring the performance of other low cost sensors, that are different in their target pollutant and sensing technology.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {In this report the performances of low-cost sensors for air pollution monitoring are evaluated in order to give guidance to users on which parameters to take into account when performing field calibration of these sensors prior to monitor air pollution with those. 
In particular, the effect of gaseous interfering compounds and meteorological conditions on four low cost sensors selected to be mounted on the AirSensEUR platform is characterised. The selected sensors are of the electrochemical type, as they are less power consuming and they have been shown, in previous studies, to lead to fastest response time and to suffer less from gaseous interferences than metal-oxide sensors. 
Ten set of four sensors for ozone (Membrapor O3/M-5), nitrogen dioxide (Alphasense NO2-B43F), carbon monoxide (Membrapor CO/MF-200) and nitrogen monoxide (Alphasense NO-B4) were evaluated under controlled conditions in a laboratory exposure chamber. The tests allow the evaluation of the interference of the gaseous compounds together with the effect of relative humidity, temperature and pressure variations. 
In general, each sensor was found to be highly linear when measuring its target gaseous species. Concerning the gaseous interferences, it appears that only the ozone sensors showed a high interference ({\textgreater} 75\%) to nitrogen dioxide. The ozone filter of the NO2-B43F appears to be effective. The sensitivity of the CO and NO sensors was sufficient to be able to detect concentration levels expected at ambient gaseous concentrations. However, the interference of NO on the CO/MF-200 was found relevant at high NO and low CO values. The cross sensitivity (CO and NO on O3 and NO2 sensors and vice-versa) was found low or not significant for each type of sensor.
The meteorological evaluation showed that the four types of sensor behave similarly concerning the temperature interference. In fact both sensors showed a quadratic response with the increase of the temperature. Relative humidity was only found relevant for the two Alphasense sensors (NO2-B43F and NO-B4) with a linear type of sensitivity associated with a clear hysteresis effect. Ambient pressure, however, was found relevant only for the two Membrapor sensors (O3/M-5 and CO/MF-200).
Finally, the good reproducibility between sensors for the majority of effects including sensitivity to gas concentration and to meteorological variables with relative standard deviation within less than 10 \% suggests that satisfactory calibration of sensors could be achieved without the need of a full characterisation of each sensor. By using calibration coefficient equal to the averages of the effects given in this report, reasonable calibration function could be established. This result is promising, allowing for future increase of the use of sensors for low cost for air pollution monitoring both by expert institutes and citizen science projects.},

	abstract = {Ever growing populations in cities are associated with a major increase in road vehicles and air pollution. The overall high levels of urban air pollution have been shown to be of a significant risk to city dwellers. However, the impacts of very high but temporally and spatially restricted pollution, and thus exposure, are still poorly understood. Conventional approaches to air quality monitoring are based on networks of static and sparse measurement stations. However, these are prohibitively expensive to capture tempo-spatial heterogeneity and identify pollution hotspots, which is required for the development of robust real-time strategies for exposure control. Current progress in developing low-cost micro-scale sensing technology is radically changing the conventional approach to allow real-time information in a capillary form. But the question remains whether there is value in the less accurate data they generate. This article illustrates the drivers behind current rises in the use of low-cost sensors for air pollution management in cities, while addressing the major challenges for their effective implementation.},

	abstract = {The very low-cost Nova particulate matter (PM) sensor SDS011 has recently drawn attention for its use for measuring PM mass concentration, which is frequently used as an indicator of air quality. However, this sensor has not been thoroughly evaluated in real-world conditions and its data quality is not well documented. In this study, three SDS011 sensors were evaluated by colocating them at an official, air quality monitoring station equipped with reference-equivalent instrumentation in Oslo, Norway. The sensors’ measurement results for PM2.5 were compared with data generated from the air quality monitoring station over almost a four-month period. Five performance aspects of the sensors were examined: operational data coverage, linearity of response and accuracy, inter-sensor variability, dependence on relative humidity (RH) and temperature (T), and potential improvement of sensor accuracy, by data calibration using a machine-learning method. The results of the study are: (i) the three sensors provide quite similar results, with intersensor correlations exhibiting R values higher than 0.97; (ii) all three sensors demonstrate quite high linearity against officially measured concentrations of PM2.5, with R2 values ranging from 0.55 to 0.71; (iii) high RH (over 80\%) negatively affected the sensor response; (iv) data calibration using only the RH and T recorded directly at the three sensors increased the R2 value from 0.71 to 0.80, 068 to 0.79, and 0.55 to 0.76. The results demonstrate the general feasibility of using these low cost SDS011 sensors for indicative PM2.5 monitoring under certain environmental conditions. Within these constraints, they further indicate that there is potential for deploying large networks of such devices, due to the sensors’ relative accuracy, size and cost. This opens up a wide variety of applications, such as high-resolution air quality mapping and personalized air quality information services. However, it should be noted that the sensors exhibit often very high relative errors for hourly values and that there is a high potential of abusing these types of sensors if they are applied outside the manufacturer-provided specifications particularly regarding relative humidity. Furthermore, our analysis covers only a relatively short time period and it is desirable to carry out longer-term studies covering a wider range of meteorological conditions.},
