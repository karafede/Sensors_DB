	abstract = {In this study, we have developed a sensitive, rapid and simple procedure for the energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) spectrometry measurement of tungsten in tobacco plant parts. Only 0.1 g of dried plant material is needed instead of the usual 1 g. EDXRF spectrometry is used for quantitative measurement, after the foliar application of solutions of tungstophosphoric acid (WPA), its magnesium salt and compounds with glycine (Gly) and alanine (Ala), in exact quantities. After that, the leaves, trunks and summits were collected and prepared separately. Tungsten is determined directly in raw dried material, and the overlap of the tungsten peak with zinc's that is present is avoided by the spectral deconvolution to obtain quantitative results. The prepared dry tablets weighed 100 mg, and measurement time was 2000 s. The radioisotope excitation source used was 109Cd and tungsten was identified and quantified at the L[alpha]1 and L[alpha]2 lines at the energies of 8397.6 eV and 8335.2 eV, respectively. EDXRF spectrometry was applied in a wide range of concentrations (up to 2000 mg/kg), with an estimated detection concentration limit of 15 mg/kg, calculated on dried material. Quantitative analysis of different parts of the treated plant plus the washings gave 94.47\% recovery of the applied tungsten in different compound forms. After the foliar application of investigated WPA compounds, there were noticed both vertical and horizontal distributions of tungsten through out the tobacco plants, according to the EDXRF spectrometry results. This conclusion is also in agreement with the positive effects of WPA on Tobacco mosaic tobamovirus (TMV) infection of Nicotiana tabacum (Solanaceae).},

The scheme has been developed on a two-step leaching method (extraction in acetate buffer and acid dissolution of residue) previously developed by authors and consists of two series of tests to be run on n pairs of equivalent parallel samples filter-collected. The first series of tests aims to assess on real samples the equivalence between results obtained by the tested procedure with those obtained by the EMEP ions extraction and the EN 12341 standard methods, whereas the second aims to evaluate the reproducibility of analytical results of elemental determination in the leached and dissolved fractions; in the latter case data reliability is also evaluated as a function of the environment-intrinsic variability of real samples.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}To avoid errors due to sampling differences data from filter pairs were standardized both by gravimetric determination of loaded filters, according to the EN 12341 standard and by the rate [SO42-]A/[SO42-]B, where [SO42-] indicate the soluble sulphate concentration in the extract; in the latter case values improved for all elements and in both fractions. Results of equivalence with standard methods and reproducibility tests are evaluated as mean relative percentage differences ([Delta]\%) and percentage elements recoveries (R\%). The application of the validation scheme to the two-step leaching method is here discussed for non-volatile ions and for 17 elements detected on 22 pairs of low-volume collected PM10 samples on Teflon filters.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

As background modelling functions, exponential and linear combinations of mutually orthogonal polynomials are considered. These functions allow the shape of the background to be determined together with the photopeak intensities. As background estimation algorithms, an iterative stripping algorithm and a background channel selection procedure which is also based on the use of orthogonal polynomials are studied. The last two methods calculate the spectral background prior to the actual fitting process. For the intercomparison, the various methods were incorporated in the software package AXIL (Analysis of X-ray spectra by means of Iterative Least Squares). By using simulated spectra in which the intensity of all lines is a priori known, the accuracy and noise-sensitivity of the different background compensation strategies are evaluated. The method in which the background is modelled as a linear combination of orthogonal polynomials is identified as being the most robust and yielding the most accurate results.},

Specifically, homogeneous glass microspheres and heterogeneous soil particle samples were prepared by both bulk and single particle sample preparation methods for evaluation by micro X-ray fluorescence. Single particle sample preparation methods allow for single particles from a collected sample to be isolated and individually presented to the micro X-ray fluorescence instrument for analysis. Various particle dispersion methods, including immobilization onto Tacky Dot(TM) slides, mounting onto double-sided sticky tape affixed to polypropylene film, or attachment to polypropylene film using 3M Artist's Adhesive, were used to separate the sample particles for single particle analysis. These methods were then compared and evaluated for their ability to disperse the particles into an array of single separated particles for optimal micro X-ray fluorescence characterization with minimal background contribution from the particle mounting surface. Bulk methods of particle sample preparation, which included pellet preparation and aerosol impaction, used a large quantity of collected single particles to make a single homogeneous specimen for presentation to the instrument for analysis. It was found that single particle elemental analysis by micro X-ray fluorescence can be performed if the particles are well separated (minimum separation distance = excitation source beam diameter) down to a particle mass of {\textasciitilde} 0.04 ng and a mean particle diameter of {\textasciitilde} 0.06 [mu]m. Homogeneous particulates can be adequately characterized by micro X-ray fluorescence using either bulk or single particle analysis methods, with no loss of analytical information. Heterogeneous samples are much harder to characterize, and both single particle as well as bulk analyses must be performed on the sample to insure full elemental characterization by micro X-ray fluorescence.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Atmospheric aerosol samples evaluated in this study were collected on cellulose fiber (Whatman-41) filters, employing a Hi-Vol sampler, at a monitoring station located on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey, between 1993 and 2001. Approximately 1700 samples were collected in this period. Six-hundred of these samples were analyzed by instrumental neutron activation (INAA), and the rest were archived. EDXRF was selected as an analytical technique to analyze 1700 aerosol samples because of its speed and non-destructive nature. However, analysis of aerosol samples collected on fiber filters with a surface technique such as EDXRF was a challenge. Penetration depth calculation performed in this study revealed that EDXRF can obtain information from top 150μm of our fiber filter material. Calibration of the instrument with currently available thin film standards caused unsatisfactory results since the actual penetration depth of particles into fiber filters were much deeper than 150μm. A method was developed in this manuscript to analyze fiber filter samples quickly with XRF. Two hundred samples that were analyzed by INAA were divided into two equal batches. One of these batches was used to calibrate the XRF and the second batch was used for verification. The results showed that developed method can be reliably used for routine analysis of fiber samples loaded with ambient aerosol.},

A new calibration procedure, based on fluorescence data of thin standard samples, was developed to determine the excitation spectrum, i.e., the product of the X-ray tube spectrum and the transmission of the used X-ray optic of a micro-XRF setup. The calibration result was validated by the quantitative analyses of certified multi-element reference standards and shows uncertainties in the order of 2\% for main components, 10\% for minor elements and 25\% for trace elements. The influence of secondary order effects like Coster-Kronig transitions and cascade effects is analyzed and the accuracy of fundamental parameters in common databases is discussed.},

Twenty-four-hour samples from both wood-burning households ("wood burners") and a reference group were analysed for mass and elemental concentration using energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) and for black smoke (BS) concentration using an EEL 43 reflectometer. Wood-smoke particles made statistically significant contributions of K, Ca, and Zn for both personal exposure and indoor concentration, the median levels of these elements being 66-80\% higher for the wood-burning group. In addition, Cl, Mn, Cu, Rb, and Pb were found to be possible markers of wood smoke, though levels of these were only significantly higher among the wood-burning group for either personal exposure or indoor concentrations. PM2.5 mass and S levels were not significantly elevated in wood burners, probably due to large variations in outdoor concentrations from long-distance transported air pollution. Personal exposure and indoor levels showed high correlations for all species, and the personal exposure levels were usually higher than or equal to the indoor levels. The associations between personal exposure and outdoor levels were generally weak except for outdoor S and PM2.5 levels that were both highly correlated with personal S exposure levels (rs{\textgreater}0.8).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The two-step method was tested on the SRM NIST 1648 for equivalence with two reference methods, the EMEP procedure for ions extraction and the EN 12341 standard for the elemental determination of the PM10 and is suitable for application to small sample amounts (less than 1 mg of particulate matter is needed), i.e. those collected by daily low volume filter-sampling. Performance times of the procedure were optimised to meet the target of routine application for large scale monitoring samples. A single ultrasonic-assisted extraction of air particulate matter is performed in 0.01 M acetate buffer at pH 4.5, followed by IC ions analysis and ICP-OES elemental analysis of the extract and by ICP-OES elemental analysis of the mineralized residue after dissolution by microwave-assisted digestion with a HNO3/H2O2 mixture. Using a pH buffered extracting solvent was preferred to water or diluted acid solutions to improve the reproducibility of metals extraction with respect to existing leaching methods; the influence of pH, nature and concentration of the buffer solution and extraction time on analytes concentration in the extract is discussed. Values of ions extraction and elements recoveries resulted fairly equivalent with those obtained by the reference methods. The study was also extended to some non-certified elements (Mg, S, Sb, Si and Ti) for their environmental significance. Elements recoveries were obtained as sum of the extract and residue fractions and were comparable with those obtained by direct dissolution. Standard deviations were within 10\% for almost all detected ions and elements.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

If this remediation volume is not properly assessed, misclassification may lead both to environmental risks (polluted soils may not be remediated) and financial risks (unexpected discovery of polluted soils may generate additional remediation costs). To minimize such risks, this paper proposes a geostatistical methodology based on stochastic simulations that allows the remediation volume and the uncertainty to be assessed using investigation data. The methodology thoroughly reproduces the conditions in which the soils are classified and extracted at the remediation stage. The validity of the approach is tested by applying it on the data collected during the investigation phase of a former lead smelting works and by comparing the results with the volume that has actually been remediated. This real remediated volume was composed of all the remediation units that were classified as polluted after systematic sampling and analysis during clean-up stage. The volume estimated from the 75 samples collected during site investigation slightly overestimates (5.3\% relative error) the remediated volume deduced from 212 remediation units. Furthermore, the real volume falls within the range of uncertainty predicted using the proposed methodology.},

Median hourly outdoor levels across all measurements were 10,800, 12,000 and 6300 cm-3 and median indoor levels were 2700, 3730 and 2580 cm-3 in summer 2005, winter 2006 and summer 2006, respectively. Outdoor levels generally exceeded indoor levels but indoor concentrations were higher around 5-7pm, suggesting a strong influence of cooking. Daily and weekly infiltration factors were estimated for each home using three methods. Weekly infiltration factors (Finf's) based on a censored indoor/outdoor ratio method varied widely across homes; median Finf's across homes were 0.16 (summer 2005), 0.21 (winter 2006) and 0.26 (summer 2006). Large indoor peaks and low infiltration of ambient PM resulted in the indoor sources generally contributing more than infiltrated ambient UFPs to indoor concentrations. Median estimates of the percentage of indoor-generated contribution to total indoor levels were 58\% (summer 2005), 65\% (winter 2006) and 69\% (summer 2006). The proportion of homes having more than half of their indoor concentrations provided by indoor sources was 66\% (summer 2005), 67\% (winter 2006) and 79\% (summer 2006). Median deposition rates ranged from 0.61-0.79 h-1 across the 3 sampling sessions. Spatial variability was higher for outdoor UFPs than concurrently measured PM2.5. The median correlations of hourly averaged outdoor UFPs between pairs of homes were moderate in the three sampling sessions (0.56-0.65), but were considerably lower than corresponding PM2.5 correlations. The wide range of infiltration factors across homes as well as the spatial variability and moderate between- home correlations of outdoor UFPs could cause measurement error in epidemiology studies that use central site UFP measurements as a surrogate for personal exposure to ambient UFPs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to devise a way to facilitate the use of fixed air monitors data in order to assess population exposure. A weighting scheme that uses the data from different monitoring sites and takes into account the time-activity patterns of the study population is proposed. PM2.5 personal monitoring data were obtained within the European EXPOLIS study, in Grenoble, France (40 adult non-smoking volunteers, winter 1997). Volunteers carried PM2.5 personal monitors during 48 h and filled in time-activity diaries. Workplaces and places of residence were classified into two categories using a Geographic Information System (GIS): some volunteersâ€™ life environments are seen as best represented by PM10 ambient air monitors located in urban background sites; others by monitors situated close to high traffic density sites (proximity sites). Measurements from the Grenoble fixed monitoring network using a TEOM PM10 sampler were available across the same period for these two types of sites (PM10back and PM10prox). These data were used to compute a translator parameter Î”i that forces the measured PM2.5 personal exposures (PM2.5persoi) to equate the average PM10 urban ambient air concentrations ([PM10back+PM10prox]/2) measured the same days. Average Î”i was 4.2 Î¼g/m3 (CI95\%[âˆ’3.4; 11.9]), with true average PM2.5 personal exposure being 36.2 Î¼g/m3 (28.2; 44.1). PM10 ambient levels at the proximity site and at the background site were respectively PM10prox=43.8 Î¼g/m3 (37.1; 50.6) and PM10back=37.0 Î¼g/m3 (31.8; 42.3). In order to assess the consistency of this approach, six scenarios of â€˜proximityâ€™ and â€˜backgroundâ€™ environments were accommodated, according to traffic intensity and road distance. Î”i was estimated for the entire EXPOLIS population and for subgroups, using terciles based on the percentage of time spent in proximity by each subject. Other similar studies need to be conducted in different urban settings, and with other pollutants, in order to assess the generalizability of this simple approach to estimate population exposures from air quality surveillance data.},

	abstract = {Apportionment of urban particulate matter (PM) to sources is central for air quality management and efficient reduction of the substantial public health risks associated with fine particles (PM2.5). Traffic is an important source combustion particles, but also a significant source of resuspended particles that chemically resemble Earth's crust and that are not affected by development of cleaner motor technologies. A substantial fraction of urban ambient PM originates from long-range transport outside the immediate urban environment including secondary particles formed from gaseous emissions of mainly sulphur, nitrogen oxides and ammonia. Most source apportionment studies are based on small number of fixed monitoring sites and capture well population exposures to regional and long-range transported particles. However, concentrations from local sources are very unevenly distributed and the results from such studies are therefore poorly representative of the actual exposures. The current study uses PM2.5 data observed at population based random sampled residential locations in Athens, Basle and Helsinki with 17 elemental constituents, selected VOCs (xylenes, trimethylbenzenes, nonane and benzene) and light absorbance (black smoke).

The major sources identified across the three cities included crustal, salt, long-range transported inorganic and traffic sources. Traffic was associated separately with source categories with crustal (especially Athens and Helsinki) and long-range transported chemical composition (all cities). Remarkably high fractions of the variability of elemental (R2\&\#xa0;\&gt;\&\#xa0;0.6 except for Ca in Basle 0.38) and chemical concentrations (R2\&\#xa0;\&gt;\&\#xa0;0.5 except benzene in Basle 0.22 and nonane in Athens 0.39) are explained by the source factors of an SEM model. The RAINS model that is currently used as the main tool in developing European air quality management policies seems to capture the local urban fraction (the city delta term) quite well, but underestimates crustal particle levels in the three cities of the current study. Utilizing structural equation modelling parallel with traditional principal component analysis (PCA) provides an objective method to determine the number of factors to be retained in a model and allows for formal hypotheses testing.},

	abstract = {It is widely accepted that concentrations of primary traffic pollutants can vary substantially across relatively small urban areas. Fixed-site monitors have been shown to be largely inadequate for representing concentrations at nearby locations, resulting in the increasing use of spatial modelling or mobile sampling methods to achieve spatial saturation. In this study, we employ the use of a simple bicycle to sample concentrations of ultrafine particles (UFPs), carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM10) at two small areas (\&lt;2.5 km2) in South Auckland, New Zealand. Portable instruments were mounted inside a custom-built casing at the front of the bicycle and every street within each study area was sampled in a grid-like fashion, at four times of day (07:00, 12:00, 17:00 and 22:00). Each area has a six-lane highway running through its centre and the core aim was to visualise and describe spatial variability of pollutant levels about the highway, main arterials and quieter streets, at periods of contrasting meteorological and traffic conditions. A total of 20 sampling runs in each area (five at each of the four timings) were conducted. Meteorological data were logged continuously at background sites within each study area. Results show that the influence of highway traffic (UFPs, CO) was strongest during the mornings and late evenings when wind speeds were low, while for the midday and afternoon timings, concentrations were highest at the arterial and shopping zones. Concentrations of PM10 appeared to be strongest in the residential areas during mornings and late evenings, suggesting an influence of wood burning for home heating. For all timings combined, for all three pollutants, it appears the arterial roads featuring shops and numerous intersections with traffic lights, had a stronger influence on concentrations than the busier but more free-flowing highways. This study provides not only an insight into microspatial hotspot variation across suburbs, but also how this variation shifts diurnally.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND, AIM AND SCOPE: The impact of air pollution on school children's health is currently one of the key foci of international and national agencies. Of particular concern are ultrafine particles which are emitted in large quantities, contain large concentrations of toxins and are deposited deeply in the respiratory tract.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, an intensive sampling campaign of indoor and outdoor airborne particulate matter was carried out in a primary school in February 2006 to investigate indoor and outdoor particle number (PN) and mass concentrations (PM(2.5)), and particle size distribution, and to evaluate the influence of outdoor air pollution on the indoor air.
RESULTS: For outdoor PN and PM(2.5), early morning and late afternoon peaks were observed on weekdays, which are consistent with traffic rush hours, indicating the predominant effect of vehicular emissions. However, the temporal variations of outdoor PM(2.5) and PN concentrations occasionally showed extremely high peaks, mainly due to human activities such as cigarette smoking and the operation of mower near the sampling site. The indoor PM(2.5) level was mainly affected by the outdoor PM(2.5) (r = 0.68, p {\textless} 0.01), whereas the indoor PN concentration had some association with outdoor PN values (r = 0.66, p {\textless} 0.01) even though the indoor PN concentration was occasionally influenced by indoor sources, such as cooking, cleaning and floor polishing activities. Correlation analysis indicated that the outdoor PM(2.5) was inversely correlated with the indoor to outdoor PM(2.5) ratio (I/O ratio; r = -0.49, p {\textless} 0.01), while the indoor PN had a weak correlation with the I/O ratio for PN (r = 0.34, p {\textless} 0.01).
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that occupancy did not cause any major changes to the modal structure of particle number and size distribution, even though the I/O ratio was different for different size classes. The I/O curves had a maximum value for particles with diameters of 100-400 nm under both occupied and unoccupied scenarios, whereas no significant difference in I/O ratio for PM(2.5) was observed between occupied and unoccupied conditions. Inspection of the size-resolved I/O ratios in the preschool centre and the classroom suggested that the I/O ratio in the preschool centre was the highest for accumulation mode particles at 600 nm after school hours, whereas the average I/O ratios of both nucleation mode and accumulation mode particles in the classroom were much lower than those of Aitken mode particles.
RECOMMENDATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES: The findings obtained in this study are useful for epidemiological studies to estimate the total personal exposure of children, and to develop appropriate control strategies for minimising the adverse health effects on school children.},

	abstract = {The temporal component of the estimation error is usually neglected in calculation of the variance of the error associated with the mapping of annual nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentration. However, under realistic hypotheses, adding a temporal term to the spatial estimation variance is convenient enough. In a survey using passive diffusion samplers, which was carried out in 2001 on the Mulhouse area, the two measurement phases do not allow calculation of variance of the temporal error. But this error is accessible by means of the few fixed analyzers that continuously measure NO2 concentrations. The statistics of the experimental temporal error are examined and the temporal variogram is calculated. Experimental quadratic error is then compared to the theoretical estimation variance, deduced from the temporal variogram. The fixed analyzers available in Alsace are then used to “optimize” empirically the duration and the date of the beginning of the temporary measurement phases. Without increasing the cost of the temporary survey, it is then possible to improve the precision of the maps of annual NO2 concentration, by combining the spatial optimization presented in Part I of the paper, and the temporal optimization presented here.},

	abstract = {During the study Relationships of Indoor, Outdoor, and Personal Air (RIOPA*), 48-hour integrated indoor, outdoor, and personal air samples were collected between summer 1999 and spring 2001 in three different areas of the United States: Elizabeth NJ, Houston TX, and Los Angeles County CA. Air samples suitable for analyzing particulate matter 2.5 microm or smaller in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) were collected in 219 homes (twice in 169 homes). Indoor and outdoor air samples suitable for gas-phase and particle-phase organic analyses were collected in 152 homes (twice in 132 homes). Samples or subsets of samples were analyzed for PM2.5 mass, organic functional groups, elements, organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), gas-phase and particle-phase polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and chlordanes. Air exchange rate (AER), temperature, and relative humidity were measured for each residence; questionnaire data and time-activity information were collected from the participants. Median indoor, outdoor, and personal PM2.5 mass concentrations were 14.4, 15.5, and 31.4 microg/m3, respectively. Personal PM2.5 concentrations were significantly higher and more variable than indoor and outdoor concentrations. Several approaches were applied to quantify indoor PM2.5 of ambient (outdoor) and nonambient (indoor) origin, some using PM2.5 mass concentrations and others using PM2.5 species concentrations. PM of outdoor origin was estimated in three ways using increasingly accurate assumptions. Comparing estimates from the three approaches enabled us to quantify several types of errors that may be introduced when central-site PM concentrations are used as surrogate estimates for PM exposure. Estimates made using individual measurements produced broader distributions and higher means than those made using a single infiltration factor for all homes and days. The best estimate (produced by the robust regression approach) of the mean contribution of outdoor PM2.5 to the indoor mass concentration was 73\% and to personal exposure was 26\%. Possible implications of exposure error for epidemiologic assessments of PM are discussed below. Organic particulate matter was the major constituent of PM2.5 generated indoors. After correcting for artifacts, it constituted 48\%, 55\%, and 61\% of PM2.5 mass inside study homes in Los Angeles, Elizabeth, and Houston, respectively. At least 40\% but probably closer to 75\% of this organic matter, on average, was emitted or formed indoors. Functional group analysis provided some insights into the composition and properties of the indoor-generated organic PM2.5. Chlordane, a very minor but mutagenic semivolatile organic mixture previously used as a termiticide, was found to be mostly of indoor origin. High emission rates were most frequently found in homes built from 1945 to 1959. Analysis of the change in gas-particle partitioning during transport of outdoor PAHs to indoor environments illustrated that chemical thermodynamics can alter the concentration and composition of outdoor PM as it is transported indoors. (This has been previously noted for nitrate [Lunden et al 2003].) In epidemiologic studies that rely on central-site monitoring data, such transformations may result in measurement error, and this possibility warrants further investigation.},

Thousand realizations of soil As are simulated by using SGS and SAS. The impacts of the number of generated realizations on the standard deviation of the soil arsenic distributions simulated by SGS and SAS were performed for assessing and mapping spatial variability and distributions of soil arsenic. The semivariogram results show that As data exhibited small scale variation in the study area. Kriging captures spatial distribution of soil As, but underestimate high As concentration area. However, both SGS and SAS well capture spatial distributions and variability of soil arsenic in the study area, but SGS results in higher average standard deviation than SAS with the same number of realizations. 40 realizations of SAS are reliable to simulate and map the distributions, variability and uncertainty of soil arsenic, but 100 realizations are needed by using SGS. Both estimates and simulates demonstrated that the high As concentration area distributed around the irrigation ditch systems and industrial plants in the study site. Finally, the cumulative distribution of soil As of 100 SGS realizations is obtained and can be used for further risk assessment.},

The ZnFe2O4-attached device gave a linear correlation between emf and the logarithm of NO2 (NO) concentration from 50 to 436 ppm in the high temperature range 600–700 °C.

We examined the response characteristics of the conducting polymer films against various sample gases over a range of temperatures of the sensitive layer. The resistance changes of both sensitive layers of pTh and pDpTh were highly dependent on the kind of layer. In particular, pTh film responded to ammonia gas and pDpTh films clearly responded to hydrophobic gases, such as chloroform, methane and ethanol. The response of these films to several gases was analyzed with a pattern recognition (PARC) algorithm. It was found that our simple gas sensor device could discriminate between the gases that were used here.},

	abstract = {A diffusion–reaction equation has been formulated and solved under non-steady condition in order to simulate how the gas concentration profile develops inside a thin film of semiconducting oxide after its exposure to a target gas. The gas concentration can be expressed by a polynomial function involving diffusion coefficient (D), rate constant (k), film thickness (L), depth from the film surface (x), time (t) and target gas concentration outside (Cs). Remarkably, the gas concentration at a given x exhibits overshooting behavior before reaching a steady value, the magnitude and appearance time of the overshooting being very dependent on x, k and L/D1/2. The overshooting appears as a result of the competition between diffusion and reaction. Two types of overshooting are recognized, which are ascribable to the gas molecules having entered from the surface and to those having reflected by the wall of substrate, respectively. Reflecting such an overshooting in gas concentration, the response transient also exhibits an overshooting phenomenon.},

Under the most suitable preparation conditions, an ordered mesoporous structure (d1 0 0=ca. 3.2 nm) with a large specific surface area (ca. 305 m2 g−1) was obtained after calcination of the resultant solid product (having ordered mesopores of d1 0 0=ca. 4.1 nm) at 600 °C for 5 h. The sensitivity of a thick film-type sensor (ca. 85 μm thick) fabricated with the mesoporous SnO2 to 500 ppm H2 (maximum sensitivity kM,H2=22.9 at 350 °C) was much higher than that to 500 ppm CO (kM,CO=3.72 at 450 °C). The H2 sensitivity of the mesoporous SnO2 sensor was superior to that of a conventional SnO2 sensor fabricated from tin oxalate, whereas the enhancement in H2 sensitivity due to the development of mesopores was not so remarkable in spite of the large specific surface area (ca. 305 m2 g−1) and small crystallite size (ca. 2 nm). The main reason for the unexpected low H2 sensitivity may arise from agglomeration of mesoporous SnO2 particles, i.e. the potential barrier height at the boundaries between agglomerated particles may be less-sensitive to H2, while that at grain boundaries of SnO2 crystallites is highly sensitive.},

Realized on p-type InP substrates, pseudo-Schottky diodes provide a n-type InP layer just beneath the Schottky metal contact which enables detection of strongly oxidizing species with no interferences coming from reducing ones. As sensitivity towards NO2 and O3 is very high even for gas concentrations commonly found into the atmosphere, these sensors can operate in real atmosphere conditions to monitor these two criteria pollutants. Limitations to their use come from response kinetics and long-term aging effects.},

	abstract = {TiO2 films with nanoholes have been prepared by anodic oxidation of a Ti plate in a H2SO4 solution. The TiO2 film sensor equipped with Pd and Ti electrodes exhibited a diode-type current–voltage characteristic in air, but nearly ohmic behavior in H2 balanced with dry air. The sensor showed quick response to H2 in dry air with high sensitivity, especially at 250 °C under a reverse bias voltage of 0.1 V. Reversible response to H2 was also achieved in N2, while the sensitivity decreased from that in air. The high H2 sensitivity in air is suggested to arise partly from the change in the height of the Schottky barrier at the interface between Pd and TiO2, and H atoms formed by dissociative adsorption of H2 at the Pd surface are assumed to play an important role in the H2 sensing properties. The sensor was less sensitive to CO, but water vapor interfered with the H2 sensitivity.},

Quartz microbalance sensors measure the mass increase of a sensitive layer caused by the absorption of analytes. In order to detect analytes which are minor components of a complex gas mixture the sensitive layers should be highly selective to these analytes. However, a high selectivity often results in slow kinetics of the absorption/desorption process. A better understanding of the kinetic reaction can help to design optimised layers and to decrease analysis time.},

The complete device includes a heating element around the membrane which is thermally decoupled with a porous silicon well of the surrounding bulk material.

The gas flows through the membrane and reacts during the passing time. The time of reaction for the gases depends on the membrane thickness. For optimised gas reaction, heating with an integrated temperature element is essential.

The fabrication process is a combination of anisotropic silicon etch processes to create a silicon membrane with porous silicon technology to perforate the membrane. Porous silicon will also be used as thermal isolation of the active membrane and the heater.},

Therefore, it is essential to have a model that can describe various spatial processes and to use appropriate techniques for estimating its parameters. The Matérn model is a generalization of several theoretical variogram models that incorporates a smoothness parameter. We show the flexibility of the Matérn model using simulation and apply the Matérn model to some soil data in Australia. Parameters of the Matérn model were determined by restricted maximum likelihood (REML), and weighted nonlinear least-squares (WNLS) on the empirical variogram. The Matérn model is shown to be flexible and can be used to describe many isotropic spatial soil processes. The REML method fits the local spatial process correctly, however the drawback is the lengthy computation. Meanwhile WNLS fits only the shape of the calculated empirical variogram, and parameters estimated from WNLS can be misleading. From this study, the smoothness parameter of soil data from point measurement appears to be in the range of 0.25–0.50 and can be considered to be a rough spatial process.},

The metals retained on the nanotube at pH 6.5 as α-benzoin oxime complexes were eluted by 10 mL 2 M HNO3 in acetone. The influence of matrix ions on the developed method was also evaluated. The preconcentration factor of the method was found to be 50. The detection limits for Cd(II), Pb(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II) were found as 1.7, 5.5, 6.0, 2.3, and 2.4 μg L−1, respectively. To test the accuracy of the method, the method was applied to TMDA-70 fortified lake water and Spinach 1570A standard reference materials.

The objective was to produce monthly pollutant concentration models for the city of Detroit, Michigan, USA from January 2008 through December 2010, in support of a related epidemiological study examining adverse birth outcomes in Detroit. Two gaseous analytes, NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) and total BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethyl-benzene, and xylene), as well as two particulate matter size fractions, PM2.5 and PM10, were investigated. The September 2008 and June 2009 datasets were modeled using ordinary kriging to produce high spatial density concentration maps with 300 m by 300 m resolution across the city. A weighted average was applied to these maps to generate a series of monthly spatial models for each pollutant. Temporal variability was then incorporated by adjusting each monthly spatial model using an average bulk shift derived from MASN time series measurements for the corresponding month over the three-year study period.

The resulting models incorporate temporal trends while preserving neighborhood scale spatial variability. Seasonal variation was evident in NO2 models, but not readily discernable in BTEX or PM models across the three year study period. The greatest spatial and temporal variability was observed in the BTEX distributions, which are inferred to be strongly influenced by local sources. The methodology employed assumes that the interpolated monthly models adequately capture spatial variability of the air pollutants across the study area, the spatial distribution of pollutant concentrations remained consistent while their magnitude fluctuated from month to month, and that the available time series measurements reflect temporal trends across the city of Detroit throughout the three-year study period.},

	abstract = {The observation sites that make up air quality monitoring networks can have very different characteristics (topography, climatology, distance to emission sources, etc), which are partially described in the meta-information provided with data sets. At the scale of Europe, the description of the sites depends on the institute(s) in charge of the air quality monitoring in each country, and is based on specific criteria that can be sometimes rather subjective. The purpose of this study is to build an objective, homogeneous, and pollutant-specific classification of European air quality monitoring sites, primarily for the purpose of model verification and chemical data assimilation.

Most studies that tackled this issue so far were based on limited data sets, and often took into account additional external data such as population density, emission estimates, or land cover maps. The present study demonstrates the feasibility of a classification only based on the past time series of measured pollutants. The underlying idea is that the true fingerprint of a given monitoring site lies within its past observation values. On each site to be categorized, eight indicators are defined to characterize each pollutant time series (O3, NO2, NO, SO2, or PM10) of the European AirBase and the French BDQA (Base de Données de Qualité de l’Air) reference sets of validated data over the period 2002–2009. A Linear Discriminant Analysis is used to best discriminate the rural and urban sites. After projection on the Fisher axis, ten classes are finally determined on the basis of fixed thresholds, for each molecule.

The method is validated by cross-validation and by direct comparison with the existing meta-data. The link between the classes obtained and the meta-data is strongest with NO, NO2, and PM10. Across Europe, the classification exhibits interesting large-scale features: some contrasts between different regions depend on the pollutant considered. Comparing the classes obtained for different pollutants at the same site reveals an interesting consistency between the separate classifications. The robustness of the method is finally assessed by comparing the classifications obtained for two distinct subsets of years. The robustness – and thus the skill of the objective classification – is satisfying for all of the species, and is highest with NO and NO2.},

A typical heavy metal contaminated site was selected for the study and Cd concentration in the topsoil was set as object. A robust variogram model was introduced to screen out a suitable variogram model. Outliers of Cd concentration in the topsoil were identified and processed and point source effects were effectively isolated with the aid of the winsorization method. Results show that the spatial variation of Cd concentration in the topsoil is great with obvious outliers. The Cressie-Hawkins robust variogram is more suitable for estimation of semi-variogram of Cd content in the topsoil. The use of the robust variogram model in couple with the winsorization method can effectively identify outliers and separate point source effects. The outliers are mainly distributed at the locations with significant human activity. As the quasi-point process often leads to great variation, the isolated point source effects can explain most of the Cd concentration in the topsoil of the sites of outliers.},

Because variogram modeling is significantly affected by outliers, methods to detect and clean outliers from data sets are critical for proper variogram modeling. In this study, we examined spatial data in the form of discrete measurements of insect counts on a rectangular grid. Two well-known insect pest population data were analyzed; one data set was the western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) on greenhouse cucumbers and the other was the greenhouse whitefly, Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood) on greenhouse cherry tomatoes. A spatial additive outlier model was constructed to detect outliers in both the isolated and patchy spatial distributions of outliers, and the outliers were cleaned with the neighboring median cleaner. To analyze the effect of outliers, we compared the relative nugget effects of data cleaned of outliers and data still containing outliers after transformation. In addition, the correlation coefficients between the actual and predicted values were compared using the leave-one-out cross-validation method with data cleaned of outliers and non-cleaned data after unbiased back transformation. The outlier detection and cleaning procedure improved geostatistical analysis, particularly by reducing the nugget effect, which greatly impacts the prediction variance of kriging. Consequently, the outlier detection and cleaning procedures used here improved the results of geostatistical analysis with highly skewed and extremely fluctuating data, such as insect counts.},

	doi = {10.1289/ehp.1205006},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A better understanding of the adverse health effects of chronic exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) requires accurate estimates of PM2.5 variation at fine spatial scales. Remote sensing has emerged as an important means of estimating PM2.5 exposures, but relatively few studies have compared remote-sensing estimates to those derived from monitor-based data.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated and compared the predictive capabilities of remote sensing and geostatistical interpolation.Methods: We developed a space-time geostatistical kriging model to predict PM2.5 over the continental United States and compared resulting predictions to estimates derived from satellite retrievals.
RESULTS: The kriging estimate was more accurate for locations that were about 100 km from a monitoring station, whereas the remote sensing estimate was more accurate for locations that were {\textgreater} 100 km from a monitoring station. Based on this finding, we developed a hybrid map that combines the kriging and satellite-based PM2.5 estimates.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that for most of the populated areas of the continental United States, geostatistical interpolation produced more accurate estimates than remote sensing. The differences between the estimates resulting from the two methods, however, were relatively small. In areas with extensive monitoring networks, the interpolation may provide more accurate estimates, but in the many areas of the world without such monitoring, remote sensing can provide useful exposure estimates that perform nearly as well.},

To date, however, estimates of the distances over which edge effects occur have generally resulted from intensive fieldwork. We present a method for estimating the distance of edge influence (DEI) – and thus the amount of forest affected by edge – from remote sensing data. We couple limited field‐based information with remote‐sensing classification techniques to locate clearings. We then develop and use a new geostatistical method – point‐based semivariogram analysis – to estimate DEI. We discuss methods of selecting inputs and methods for classification, and compare global, local, and point‐based methods of estimating DEI. We also demonstrate the use of idealized versions of actual landscapes to clarify complex behavior of semivariograms. Our technique can be generalized to edges in other forest types as well as to other approximately point‐based disturbances that produce an outwardly diminishing gradient of effects.},

During the latter period, monitoring locations were also operated along the boundaries and across the width of the Valley. The Corcoran, Bakersfield, and Fresno networks consisted of 12–25 sites, located in areas of about 300–800 km2.

Mean concentrations of PM10 and its constituents varied from core-site concentrations by 20\% or more over distances ranging from 4 to 14 km. Local source influences were observed to affect sites over distances of less than 1 km, but primary particulate emissions were also transported over urban or sub-regional scales of approximately 10–30 km during the winter and greater than 30 km in the fall.

Spatial representativeness defines to what extent the monitoring data is meaningful and useful in a spatial context. Within this paper a generic and robust methodology is presented for the assessment of the spatial representativeness of air pollution monitoring sites. The methodology relies on a statistical approach that links annual averaged concentration levels with land use characteristics. The methodology is demonstrated for the monitoring sites in the Belgian telemetric air quality network and then applied to define a set of zones with a given confidence level. Within such a zone the concentrations deviate to a maximum percentage from the measured values at the monitoring sites. Furthermore, the relevance of spatial representativeness for model validation is addressed and the technique is illustrated for the validation of the results of the regional air quality model BelEUROS. In general, the overall improvement of the model validation by taking into account spatial representativeness can be quantified as in the order of 20\%.},

Because of unavoidable technical incidents, the total number of “annual” measurements collected is limited to a few tens, which is not sufficient for estimating precise maps. NO2 comes mainly from the combustion of fossil hydrocarbons. Auxiliary variables like emission inventories, population density or land use, giving an approximate description of those emitters, may be entered in the mapping process as additional information. For two French cities (Mulhouse and Montpellier) with different geographic context, the relationships between seasonal NO2 concentrations and auxiliary variables are thoroughly examined. A high correlation between seasonal concentrations is shown, as the difference of spatial structures consistency for winter and summer concentrations. The usual cross validation method brings out the interest of cokriging the annual concentration from the seasonal measurements, with auxiliary variables as external drift. This approach ensures the consistency of seasonal or yearly concentration estimations and allows a greater precision by the use of all available measurements.},

	abstract = {In climatology, spatial representativeness can be measured as the degree to which an instrumental temperature record resolves the climatic variability across an area. Some station records may disproportionately resolve characteristics of their immediate surroundings and, therefore, have less utility in representing climate (or weather) over larger spatial scales. To evaluate spatial representativeness of historical air-temperature records, a modified geostatistical procedure was developed. The procedure measures the spatial representativeness of a station based on variogram parameter estimates—in this case the nugget. This application is novel for two reasons: (1) variogram models are fit to station-specific or "point-centered" semivariance and (2) variogram models are fit to semivariance computed at intervals in a time series. Fitting variograms to point-centered semivariance may be used to create time series of nuggets for each station in a network. Nugget time series may show subsets of a time series that are spatially unrepresentative. These periods could be omitted from climatological analyses without excluding the entire station record. Examples from the central-U.S. subset of the Daily Historical Climatology Network illustrate how anomalous nuggets or step changes in nuggets can be identified relative to station changes.},

	abstract = {Maps of pollutants concentration are usually generated by means of interpolation and extrapolation methods. The quality of the results depends mainly of the number of permanent or temporary measuring stations. This paper deals with a method for the virtual densification of the network of stations. The method creates “virtual measuring stations”. It aims at improving the quality of interpolation by increasing the number of data on pollutant concentration. The virtual stations are determined by the means of a classification method applied to each pixel of the area under concern. Discriminating elements are pollutants emission classes, land cover types, urban morphological indicators created to this purpose and distance to major roads. A first implementation was made for particulate matter (PM) for the city of Strasbourg (France) using thin-plates spline interpolation method in Arcview 9 GIS. The relative Root Mean Square Error decreases from 49\% for five input stations down to 15\% for the virtual stations.},

A new spatial analysis technique - fuzzy membership grade Kriging with semi-statistical membership, proposed by Guo has been developed to address fuzzy spatial data recorded as crisp numbers. In this paper, we will explain fuzzy membership grade Kriging, its root, its theory and its implementations. As an illustration, we will use PM10 data of California, USA. Three sample membership functions are extracted from the data itself: linear, quadratic and hyperbolic tangent and applied to the PM10 data. The predicted membership grades are also transformed back into PM10 concentrations by using inverse functions in order to identify areas being dangerous to human health. Finally, we implement our new fuzzy membership grade Kriging in GIS.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This issue is linked to evaporative emissions from chemical compounds used in some of the vehicles’ interior elements, such as the dashboard, seat etc. The mutual resolution contains provisions and harmonized test procedures for the measurement of interior air emissions from interior materials.

1.2	However, other important sources of air pollution in the vehicle cabin include harmful substances entering into the cabin through the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system (HVAC), and through other leaks in the vehicle cabin. The sources of these substances coming into the cabin include vehicle exhaust gases, fuel vapors, and the outside air pollution. The list of chemical substances includes CO, NO, NO2, SO2, volatile organic compounds (VOC), formaldehyde (СН2О), aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, particulate matter (PM). 

1.3	The group considered the inclusion in the scope of interior air pollutants from outside sources as a possible extension of the mandate at this stage. As an extension of the existing Mutual Resolution on VIAQ, this will take into account both interior air emissions generated from interior materials and exhaust gases from the vehicle entering into the cabin. Since there are too many variables in regards to outside air pollution sources, this stage will not address outside air pollution originating from any source other than the vehicle itself.},

	abstract = {Four different continuous radon (222Rn)-detection systems have been compared in underground environments, namely three subhorizontal tunnels excavated for groundwater exploitation. Within observational uncertainties, all sensors detected the same concentrations of radon in the air of the tunnels, regardless of the methodology used to measure this radioactive gas. In this sense, the choice of continuous long-term radon monitoring sensors in underground tunnels is constrained by factors such as robustness of the instrumentation, power supply and cost, rather than the sensitivity of the detection methodology. This is particularly important for the monitoring of radon in the context of seismo-volcanic surveillance, where the harsh environmental conditions of the monitoring sites and the absence of electrical power supply are key factors to take into account.},

	abstract = {Common definitions for the spatial representativeness of air quality monitoring sites are based on the evaluation of the similarity of pollutant concentrations, in which the representativeness area of a monitoring site is basically described by the set of all locations where the concentration of a pollutant does not differ from the measurements at the central point by more than a certain threshold.
Classical geostatistical analysis describes the spatial correlation structure of a concentration field in terms of the variogram. In contrary, the point centred variography is based on the average of squared concentration differences observed in pairs formed between a particular central point and the set of all other points in the domain. It thereby places a monitoring station in the context of the local or regional air quality pattern.
In this report we demonstrate how a mathematical inversion of the point centred variogram can provide information about the extent of the spatial representativeness area of a monitoring site. The application of this approach is tested on a set of modelling data from the city of Antwerp. This dataset contains information at a very high spatial (street level) and temporal resolution for three main pollutants (PM10, NO2 and Ozone), over the whole city. Furthermore, FAIRMODE (Forum for Air Quality Modeling in Europe) is currently concluding an intercomparison exercise on spatial representativeness methods, which is also based on sharing this same dataset.},

	abstract = {Air quality monitoring is extremely important as air pollution has a direct impact on human health. Low-cost gas sensors are used to effectively perceive the environment by mounting them on top of mobile vehicles, for example, using a public transport network. Thus, these sensors are part of a mobile network and perform from time to time measurements in each others vicinity. In this paper, we study three calibration algorithms that exploit co-located sensor measurements to enhance sensor calibration and consequently the quality of the pollution measurements on-the-fly. Forward calibration, based on a traditional approach widely used in the literature, is used as performance benchmark for two novel algorithms: backward and instant calibration. We validate all three algorithms with real ozone pollution measurements carried out in an urban setting by comparing gas sensor output to high-quality measurements from analytical instruments. We find that both backward and instant calibration reduce the average measurement error by a factor of two compared to forward calibration. Furthermore, we unveil the arising difficulties if sensor calibration is not based on reliable reference measurements but on sensor readings of low-cost gas sensors which is inevitable in a mobile scenario with only a few reliable sensors. We propose a solution and evaluate its effect on the measurement accuracy in experiments and simulation.},

	abstract = {Up-to-date information on urban air pollution is of great importance for environmental protection agencies to assess air quality and provide advice to the general public in a timely manner. In particular, ultrafine particles (UFPs) are widely spread in urban environments and may have a severe impact on human health. However, the lack of knowledge about the spatio-temporal distribution of UFPs hampers profound evaluation of these effects. In this paper, we analyze one of the largest spatially resolved UFP data set publicly available today containing over 50 million measurements. We collected the measurements throughout more than two years using mobile sensor nodes installed on top of public transport vehicles in the city of Zurich, Switzerland. Based on these data, we develop land-use regression models to create pollution maps with a high spatial resolution of 100 m × 100 m. We compare the accuracy of the derived models across various time scales and observe a rapid drop in accuracy for maps with sub-weekly temporal resolution. To address this problem, we propose a novel modeling approach that incorporates past measurements annotated with metadata into the modeling process. In this way, we achieve a 26\% reduction in the root-mean-square error–a standard metric to evaluate the accuracy of air quality models–of pollution maps with semi-daily temporal resolution. We believe that our findings can help epidemiologists to better understand the adverse health effects related to UFPs and serve as a stepping stone towards detailed real-time pollution assessment.},

However, temporal drift, cross-sensitivity and effects caused by varying environmental conditions (e.g., temperature) in low-cost chemical sensors (typically used in mobile WSNs) pose a tough challenge for reliable calibration. Based on state-of-the-art rendezvous calibration methods, we propose a novel model-based method for automatically estimating the baseline and gain characteristics of low-cost chemical sensors taking temporal drift and temperature dependencies of the sensors into account. The performance of our algorithm is evaluated using data gathered by our long-term mobile sensor network deployment, developed within the Nano-Tera.ch OpenSense II project1 in Lausanne, Switzerland. We show that, in a realistic context of sparse and irregular rendezvous events, our method consistently improves rendezvous calibration performance for single-hop online calibration.},

The test in the field, performed in collaboration with the local environmental agency, revealed that the sensors can provide accurate data if properly calibrated and maintained.

	abstract = {Evidence is increasing that long-term exposure to ambient air pollution is associated with deaths from cardiopulmonary diseases. In a 2002 pilot study, we reported clear indications that traffic-related air pollution, especially at the local scale, was related to cardiopulmonary mortality in a randomly selected subcohort of 5000 older adults participating in the ongoing Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS) on diet and cancer. In the current study, referred to as NLCS-AIR, our objective was to obtain more precise estimates of the effects of traffic-related air pollution by analyzing associations with cause-specific mortality, as well as lung cancer incidence, in the full cohort of approximately 120,000 subjects. Cohort members were 55 to 69 years of age at enrollment in 1986. Follow-up was from 1987 through 1996 for mortality (17,674 deaths) and from late 1986 through 1997 for lung cancer incidence (2234 cases). Information about potential confounding variables and effect modifiers was available from the questionnaire that subjects completed at enrollment and from publicly available data (including neighborhood-scale information such as income distributions). The NLCS was designed for a case-cohort approach, which makes use of all the cases in the full cohort, while data for the random subcohort are used to estimate person-time experience in the study. Full information on confounders was available for the subjects in the random subcohort and for the emerging cases of mortality and lung cancer incidence during the follow-up period, and in NLCS-AIR we used the case-cohort approach to examine the relation between exposure to air pollution and cause-specific mortality and lung cancer. We also specified a standard Cox proportional hazards model within the full cohort, for which information on potential confounding variables was much more limited. Exposure to air pollution was estimated for the subjects' home addresses at baseline in 1986. Concentrations were estimated for black smoke (a simple marker for soot) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) as indicators of traffic-related air pollution, as well as nitric oxide (NO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter {\textless} or = 2.5 microm (PM2.5), as estimated from measurements of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter {\textless} or = 10 microm (PM10). Overall long-term exposure concentrations were considered to be a function of air pollution contributions at regional, urban, and local scales. We used interpolation from data obtained routinely at regional stations of the National Air Quality Monitoring Network (NAQMN) to estimate the regional component of exposure at the home address. Average pollutant concentrations were estimated from NAQMN measurements for the period 1976 through 1996. Land-use regression methods were used to estimate the urban exposure component. For the local exposure component, geographic information systems (GISs) were used to generate indicators of traffic exposure that included traffic intensity on and distance to nearby roads. A major effort was made to collect traffic intensity data from individual municipalities. The exposure variables were refined considerably from those used in the pilot study, but we also analyzed the data for the full cohort in the current study using the exposure indicators of the pilot study. We analyzed the data in models with the estimated overall pollutant concentration as a single variable and with the background concentration (the sum of regional and urban components) and the local exposure estimate from traffic indicators as separate variables. In the full-cohort analyses adjusted for the limited set of confounders, estimated overall exposure concentrations of black smoke, NO2, NO, and PM2.5 were associated with mortality. For a 10-microg/m3 increase in the black smoke concentration, the relative risk (RR) (95\% confidence interval [CI]) was 1.05 (1.00-1.11) for natural-cause (nonaccidental) mortality, 1.04 (0.95-1.13) for cardiovascular mortality, 1.22 (0.99-1.50) for respiratory mortality, 1.03 (0.88-1.20) for lung cancer mortality, and 1.04 (0.97-1.12) for noncardiopulmonary, non-lung cancer mortality. Results were similar for NO2, NO, and PM2.5. For a 10-microg/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentration, the RR for natural-cause mortality was 1.06 (95\% CI, 0.97-1.16), the same as in the results of the American Cancer Society Study reported by Pope and colleagues in 2002. The highest relative risks were found for respiratory mortality, though confidence intervals were wider for this less-frequent cause of death. No associations with mortality were found for SO2. Some of the associations between the traffic indicator variables used to assess traffic intensity near the home and mortality reached statistical significance in the full cohort. For an increase in traffic intensity of 10,000 motor vehicles in 24 hours (motor vehicles/day) on the road nearest a subject's residence, the RR was 1.03 (95\% CI, 1.00-1.08) for natural-cause mortality, 1.05 (0.99-1.12) for cardiovascular mortality, 1.10 (0.95-1.26) for respiratory mortality, 1.07 (0.96-1.19) for lung cancer mortality, and 1.00 (0.94-1.06) for noncardiopulmonary, non-lung cancer mortality. Results were similar for traffic intensity in a 100-m buffer around the subject's residence and living near a major road (a road with more than 10,000 motor vehicles/day). Distance in meters to the nearest major road and traffic intensity on the nearest major road were not associated with any of the mortality outcomes. We did not find an association between cardiopulmonary mortality and living near a major road as defined using the methods of the pilot study. In the case-cohort analyses adjusted for all potential confounders, we found no associations between background air pollution and mortality. The associations between traffic intensity and mortality were weaker than in the full cohort, and confidence intervals were wider, consistent with the smaller number of subjects. The lower relative risks of mortality associated with traffic variables in the case-cohort study population could be related to the particular subcohort that was randomly selected from the full cohort, as the risks estimated with the actual subcohort were well below the average estimates obtained for 100 new case-cohort analyses with 100 alternative subcohorts of 5000 subjects each that we randomly selected from the full cohort. Differences in adjusted relative risks between the full-cohort and the case-cohort analyses could be explained by random error introduced by sampling from the full cohort and by a selection effect resulting from the relatively large number of missing data for variables in the extensive confounder model used in the case-cohort analyses. More complete control for confounding probably did not contribute much to the lower relative risks in the case-cohort analyses, especially for the traffic variables, as results were similar when the limited confounder model for the full cohort was used in analyses of the subjects in the case-cohort study population. In additional analyses using black smoke concentrations as the exposure variables, we found that the association between overall black smoke and cardiopulmonary mortality was somewhat stronger for case-cohort subjects who did not change residence during follow-up, and in the full cohort, there was a tendency for relative risks to be higher for subjects living in the three major cities included in the study. Adjustment for estimated exposure to traffic noise did not affect the associations of background black smoke and traffic intensity with cardiovascular mortality. There was some indication of an association between traffic noise and cardiovascular mortality only for the 1.6\% of the subjects in the full cohort who were exposed to traffic noise in the highest category of {\textgreater} 65 A-weighted decibels (dB(A); decibels with the sound pressure scale adjusted to conform with the frequency response of the human ear). Examination of sex, smoking status, educational level, and vegetable and fruit intake as possible effect modifiers showed that for overall black smoke concentrations, associations with mortality tended to be stronger in case-cohort subjects with lower levels of education and those with low fruit intake, but differences between strata were not statistically significant. For lung cancer incidence, we found essentially no relation to exposure to NO2, black smoke, PM2.5, SO2, or several traffic indicators. Associations of overall air pollution concentrations and traffic indicator variables with lung cancer incidence were, however, found in subjects who had never smoked, with an RR of 1.47 (95\% CI, 1.01-2.16) for a 10-microg/m3 increase in overall black smoke concentration. In the current study, the mortality risks associated with both background air pollution and traffic exposure variables were much smaller than the estimate previously reported in the pilot study for risk of cardiopulmonary mortality associated with living near a major road (RR, 1.95; 95\% CI, 1.09-3.51). The differences are most likely due to the extension of the follow-up period in the current study and to random error in the pilot study related to sampling from the full cohort. Though relative risks were generally small in the current study, long-term average concentrations of black smoke, NO2, and PM2.5 were related to mortality, and associations of black smoke and NO2 exposure with natural-cause and respiratory mortality were statistically significant. Traffic intensity near the home was also related to natural-cause mortality. The highest relative risks associated with background air pollution and traffic variables were for respiratory mortality, though the number of deaths was smaller than for the other mortality categories.

	abstract = {Background Time series analysis is the most commonly used technique for assessing the association between counts of health events over time and exposure to ambient air pollution. Recently, case-crossover analysis has been proposed as an alternative analytical approach. While each technique has its own advantages and disadvantages, there remains considerable uncertainty as to which statistical methodology is preferable for evaluating data of this type.Methods The objective of this paper is to evaluate the performance of different variations of these two procedures using computer simulation. Hospital admission data were generated under realistic models with known parameters permitting estimates based on time series and case-crossover analyses to be compared with these known values.Results While accurate estimates can be achieved with both methods, both methods require some decisions to be made by the researcher during the course of the analysis. With time series analysis, it is necessary to choose the time span in the LOESS smoothing process, or degrees of freedom when using natural cubic splines. For case-crossover studies using either uni- or bi-directional control selection strategies, the choice of time intervals needs to be made.Conclusions We prefer the times series approach because the best estimates of risk that can be obtained with time series analysis are more precise than the best estimates based on case-crossover analysis.},

	abstract = {The epidemiological studies which have had significant impact on the setting of National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQSs) were performed more than twenty years ago. Most of the more recent studies have been seriously flawed in their design and/or execution because they neglected to account for important variables such as: pollutant exposures other than those from ambient air; the influence of personal activity on pollutant uptake; host responsiveness; and the separate contributions of recent transient peak exposures and long-term chronic exposures on the effects endpoints. For particulate pollutants, the influence of composition and size distribution has also received too little consideration. In order to address these deficiencies, research and methods development are needed on: indices for particulate exposures; identification of exposures relevant to the effects; improved indices of effects; acquisition of response data; identification of exposed populations; and identification of susceptible subgroups. Approaches to these needs are discussed, along with brief reviews of several recent studies that have focused on critical issues of concern, made the necessary efforts to characterize the relevant exposures of the populations being studied, and demonstrated human responses to ambient pollutants at current exposure levels.},

	abstract = {Exposure protocols were designed to ask whether lung damage in rats exposed to either ozone or nitrogen dioxide is proportional to dose rate or to cumulative dose. Thus, the response of rats to a constant product of concentration of oxidant air pollutant and time of exposure (C Ã— T) was evaluated for 3-day exposures over a fourfold range of concentrations of ozone (0.2â€“0.8 ppm) or of nitrogen dioxide (3.6â€“14.4 ppm) for exposure durations of 6â€“24 hr per day. The response of rat lungs was quantified by changes in total protein content of lung lavage supernatants or by changes in content of specific cell types in lung lavage pellets. The results of these experiments clearly demonstrate that acute lung damage is a function of cumulative dose (that is, C Ã— T product) for the three highest dose rates tested. However, when exposure duration is extended to include the entire 24-hr period (the lowest dose rate tested), there is a marked attenuation of pulmonary response. Rats were also exposed to mixtures of ozone and nitrogen dioxide with the C Ã— T product held constant. Our results clearly demonstrate that when rats are exposed to combinations of ozone and nitrogen dioxide, lung damage is a function of peak concentration rather than a function of cumulative dose. This deviation from Haber's Law is attributed to a concentration-dependent, synergistic (greater than additive) response to this specific mixture of oxidant air pollutants.},

	issn = {1041-5505},
	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19554968},
	abstract = {Around the world, daily variations in ambient air pollution have been consistently associated with variations in daily mortality. The aim of the study presented here was to assess the effects of ambient air pollution on daily mortality during a period of tremendous changes in air quality in the city of Erfurt, in eastern Germany, from October 1991 to March 2002. Data on particle size distributions were obtained from September 1995 to March 2002 at a research monitoring station. For particles from 0.01 microm to 2.5 microm in diameter, number concentrations (NCs)* and mass concentrations (MCs) were calculated. Particles with diameters less than or equal to 0.10 microm are defined as ultrafine particles (UFP). Data on the gaseous pollutants NO2, CO, SO2, and O3 and on PM10 (particulate matter [PM] with aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 10 microm) were obtained from a government air-monitoring station. Data on changes in energy consumption, car fleet composition, and population were collected from local authorities. Death certificates of persons living in and dying in Erfurt were abstracted, and daily mortality counts were calculated. Poisson regression models were used to analyze the data, applying penalized splines (also known as P-splines) to model nonlinear relationships in the confounders. Model selection was done without air pollutants in the models, based on a combination of goodness-of-fit criteria and avoidance of autocorrelation in error terms. Final models included P-splines of time trend, meteorologic data, and influenza epidemics as well as day of the week with an indicator variable. Results are presented as change per interquartile range (IQR), i.e., change in the relative risk of mortality associated with a change in the concentration from the 25th to the 75th percentile of a given pollutant. Air pollutants were considered both as linear terms and as P-splines to assess the exposure-response functions. Changes in effect estimates over time were calculated using fully Bayesian time-varying coefficient models. This method was selected over four other approaches tested in simulation studies. Air-pollution concentrations decreased substantially in Erfurt during the decade under observation. The strongest changes were observed for SO2, for which annual concentrations decreased from 64 microg/m3 in 1992 to 4 microg/m3 in 2001. Concentrations of PM10, PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 microm), and CO decreased by more than 50\%. NO2, O3, and ultrafine particles also decreased, though to a lesser extent. Based on visual inspection of the data on the changes in ambient air-pollution concentrations during the study period, we defined three study subperiods: A first subperiod from 1991 to 1995; a second, transitional subperiod from 1995 to 1998; and a third subperiod from 1998 to 2002. Generally, air-pollution concentrations decreased substantially from the first subperiod to the second, and some additional decreases occurred from the second subperiod to the third. During the second, transitional subperiod, natural gas replaced coal as the main energy source in Erfurt. In addition, the number of cars with catalytic converters increased over time, as did the number of cars in general. To facilitate the interpretation of the results, we organized the air pollutants into four groups: (1) NO2, CO, and ultrafine particles, (2) PM10 and PM2.5, (3) SO2, and (4) O3. We observed a 1.6\% increased risk for daily mortality (CI, -0.4\% to 3.5\%) for an increase of 19.7 microg/m3 in NO2 (lag day 3), a 1.9\% increased risk (CI, 0.2\%-3.6\%) for an increase of 0.48 mg/m3 in CO (lag day 4), and a 2.9\% increased risk (CI, 0.3\%-5.5\%) for an increase of 9743/cm3 in ultrafine particles (lag day 4). No consistent associations were observed for PM10, PM2.5, or SO2. For O3, a 4.6\% increased risk for daily mortality (CI, 1.1\%-8.3\%) was associated with a 43.8 microg/m3 maximum 8-hr concentration of O3 per day (lag day 2). For all four pollutants, exposure-response functions suggested no deviation from linearity. However, in time-varying models the strongest associations were observed for NO2, CO, and ultrafine particles during the transition subperiod, from 1995 to 1998, when O3 concentrations were lowest. Changes in source characteristics or ambient air-pollution concentrations were not able to explain these observations in a straightforward manner. However, the observations suggested that changes such as the introduction of three-way catalytic converters in cars and the substitution natural gas for coal might have been beneficial. Overall we concluded that: 1. Economic and political changes and the adoption of new technologies in eastern Germany resulted in distinct improvements in ambient air quality; 2. Urban air pollution in Erfurt changed within one decade from the eastern mixture toward that of western Europe ("western mixture"), which is dominated by concentrations of NOx, O3, fine particles, and ultrafine particles with low concentrations of SO2; 3. There was an association between daily mortality and ultrafine particles and combustion-related gases (lag days 3 or 4); 4. Ultrafine particles seemed to be the best pollution indicator and to point to the role of local combustion in the pollution mixture; 5. Regression coefficients showed variation over time for NO2, CO, ultrafine particles, and O3 that could not be explained by nonlinearity in the exposure-response functions; 6. Mortality associated with pollution was lower at the end of the 1990s than during the 1990s, except for mortality associated with O3; and 7. Mortality associated with pollution was strongest in the second, transitional subperiod, from 1995 to 1998, when changes in source characteristics had taken place but the benefits of improved ambient air quality had not yet been completely achieved.},

To study the pollution of atmospheric particles at winter in Beijing and compare the lung toxicity which induced by particle samples from different sampling sites.Method
We collected samples from two sampling points during the winter for toxicity testing and chemical analysis. Wistar rats were administered with particles by intratracheal instillation. After exposure, biochemically index, esimmunity indexes, histopathology and DNA damage were detected in rat pulmonary cells.Result
The elements with enrichment factors (EF) larger than 10 were As, Cd, Cu, Zn, S and Pb in the four experiment groups. The priority control of the total concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in PM10 and PM2.5 of Near-traffic source was much higher than that of Far-traffic source, it demonstrated that near the traffic source of PAHs pollution was heavier than that of Far-traffic source, as it was close to main roads Beiyuan Road, motor vehicle emissions were much higher. The pathology of lung showed that the degree of inflammation was increased with the particle diameter minished, it was the same as the detection of biochemical parameters such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Total antioxidant status(T-AOC) and total protein (TP) in BALF and inflammation cytokine(interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) in lung homogenate. The indexes of DNA damage including the content of DNA and Olive empennage of PM2.5 were significant higher than that of PM10 at the same surveillance point (P {\textless} 0.05), near-traffic particles were higher than the far-traffic particles at the same diameter, (P {\textless} 0.05).Conclusion
Near-traffic area particles had certain pollution at winter in Beijing. Meanwhile, atmospheric particulate matters on lung toxicity were related to the particles size and distance related sites which were exposed: smaller size, more toxicity; nearer from traffic, more toxicity.},

	abstract = {This review describes databases of small-scale spatial variations and indoor, outdoor and personal measurements of air pollutants with the main focus on suspended particulate matter, and to a lesser extent, nitrogen dioxide and photochemical pollutants. The basic definitions and concepts of an exposure measurement are introduced as well as some study design considerations and implications of imprecise exposure measurements. Suspended particulate matter is complex with respect to particle size distributions, the chemical composition and its sources. With respect to small-scale spatial variations in urban areas, largest variations occur in the ultrafine (\&lt;0.1 μm) and the coarse mode (PM10–2.5, resuspended dust). Secondary aerosols which contribute to the accumulation mode (0.1–2 μm) show quite homogenous spatial distribution. In general, small-scale spatial variations of PM2.5 were described to be smaller than the spatial variations of PM10. Recent studies in outdoor air show that ultrafine particle number counts have large spatial variations and that they are not well correlated to mass data. Sources of indoor particles are from outdoors and some specific indoor sources such as smoking and cooking for fine particles or moving of people (resuspension of dust) for coarse particles. The relationships between indoor, outdoor and personal levels are complex. The finer the particle size, the better becomes the correlation between indoor, outdoor and personal levels. Furthermore, correlations between these parameters are better in longitudinal analyses than in cross-sectional analyses. For NO2 and O3, the air chemistry is important. Both have considerable small-scale spatial variations within urban areas. In the absence of indoor sources such as gas appliances, NO2 indoor/outdoor relationships are strong. For ozone, indoor levels are quite small. The study hypothesis largely determines the choice of a specific concept in exposure assessment, i.e. whether personal sampling is needed or if ambient monitoring is sufficient. Careful evaluation of the validity and improvements in precision of an exposure measure reduce error in the measurements and bias in the exposure–effect relationship.},

	abstract = {This report describes a previously uncharacterized occupational health hazard: work crew exposures to respirable crystalline silica during hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing involves high pressure injection of large volumes of water and sand, and smaller quantities of well treatment chemicals, into a gas or oil well to fracture shale or other rock formations, allowing more efficient recovery of hydrocarbons from a petroleum-bearing reservoir. Crystalline silica ('frac sand') is commonly used as a proppant to hold open cracks and fissures created by hydraulic pressure. Each stage of the process requires hundreds of thousands of pounds of quartzcontaining sand; millions of pounds may be needed for all zones of a well. Mechanical handling of frac sand creates respirable crystalline silica dust, a potential exposure hazard for workers. Researchers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health collected 111 personal breathing zone samples at 11 sites in five states to evaluate worker exposures to respirable crystalline silica during hydraulic fracturing. At each of the 11 sites, full-shift samples exceeded occupational health criteria (e.g., the Occupational Safety and Health Administration calculated permissible exposure limit, the NIOSH recommended exposure limit, or the ACGIH threshold limit value), in some cases, by 10 or more times the occupational health criteria. Based on these evaluations, an occupational health hazard was determined to exist for workplace exposures to crystalline silica. Seven points of dust generation were identified, including sand handlingmachinery and dust generated from the work site itself. Recommendations to control exposures include product substitution (when feasible), engineering controls or modifications to sand handling machinery, administrative controls, and use of personal protective equipment. To our knowledge, this represents the first systematic study of work crew exposures to crystalline silica during hydraulic fracturing. Companies that conduct hydraulic fracturing using silica sand should evaluate their operations to determine the potential for worker exposure to respirable crystalline silica and implement controls as necessary to protect workers.

Median hourly outdoor levels across all measurements were 10,800, 12,000 and 6300 cm-3 and median indoor levels were 2700, 3730 and 2580 cm-3 in summer 2005, winter 2006 and summer 2006, respectively. Outdoor levels generally exceeded indoor levels but indoor concentrations were higher around 5-7pm, suggesting a strong influence of cooking. Daily and weekly infiltration factors were estimated for each home using three methods. Weekly infiltration factors (Finf's) based on a censored indoor/outdoor ratio method varied widely across homes; median Finf's across homes were 0.16 (summer 2005), 0.21 (winter 2006) and 0.26 (summer 2006). Large indoor peaks and low infiltration of ambient PM resulted in the indoor sources generally contributing more than infiltrated ambient UFPs to indoor concentrations. Median estimates of the percentage of indoor-generated contribution to total indoor levels were 58\% (summer 2005), 65\% (winter 2006) and 69\% (summer 2006). The proportion of homes having more than half of their indoor concentrations provided by indoor sources was 66\% (summer 2005), 67\% (winter 2006) and 79\% (summer 2006). Median deposition rates ranged from 0.61-0.79 h-1 across the 3 sampling sessions. Spatial variability was higher for outdoor UFPs than concurrently measured PM2.5. The median correlations of hourly averaged outdoor UFPs between pairs of homes were moderate in the three sampling sessions (0.56-0.65), but were considerably lower than corresponding PM2.5 correlations. The wide range of infiltration factors across homes as well as the spatial variability and moderate between- home correlations of outdoor UFPs could cause measurement error in epidemiology studies that use central site UFP measurements as a surrogate for personal exposure to ambient UFPs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Abstract
Epidemiological studies have reported that both ozone (O3) and temperature are associated with daily mortality. However, few studies have explored the interactive effect between O3 and temperature on mortality. Moreover, whether different O3 metrics influence this interaction is still unknown. This study used a Poisson generalized additive model to examine the interactive effects of daily average temperature and O3 on mortality in Suzhou between 2008 and 2009. The results showed that the O3 effects were stronger in cold season and low temperature days. On days with low temperatures (0th–25th percentile), an interquartile range increment in 1-h maximum O3 corresponded to a 15.96\% (95\% CI: 1.52, 32.45) increase in total mortality and an 18.77\% (95\% CI: 0.09, 40.95) increase in cardiovascular mortality. On days with normal temperatures (26th–75th percentile) or high temperatures (76th–100th percentile), the estimates were only 2.04\% (95\% CI: −5.94, 10.69) or 1.65\% (95\% CI: −3.21, 6.76) for total mortality, and 7.82\% (95\% CI: −15.21, 37.10) or 6.14\% (95\% CI: −17.35, 36.31) for cardiovascular mortality. Using an 8-h maximum metric yielded similar interactive effects between ozone and temperature. For total and cardiovascular mortality, evidence indicates that low temperature has a stronger modifying effect on the 1-h maximum and the maximum 8-h average O3 concentrations than the 24-h average O3 concentrations. The interaction pattern of O3 with temperature was less sensitive at different cut-offs for temperature levels and including co-pollutants in the models. Our findings provide evidence that low daily average temperature significantly modifies the acute effects of ozone on daily mortality for both the 1-h maximum metric and the maximum 8-h average metric in Suzhou, China.},

	abstract = {According to European Union (EU) legislation, ozone (O3) monitoring sites can be classified regarding their location (rural background, rural, suburban, urban) or based on the presence of emission sources (background, traffic, industrial). There have been attempts to improve these classifications aiming to reduce their ambiguity and subjectivity, but although scientifically sound, they lack the simplicity needed for operational purposes. We present a simple methodology for classifying O3 stations based on the characteristics of frequency distribution curves which are indicative of the actual impact of combustion sources emitting NO that consumes O3 via titration. Four classes are identified using 1998–2012 hourly data from 72 stations widely distributed in mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands. Types 1 and 2 present unimodal bell-shaped distribution with very low amount of data near zero reflecting a limited influence of combustion sources while Type 4 has a primary mode close to zero, showing the impact of combustion sources, and a minor mode for higher concentrations. Type 3 stations present bimodal distributions with the main mode in the higher levels. We propose a quantitative metric based on the Gini index with the objective of reproducing this classification and finding empirical ranges potentially useful for future classifications. The analysis of the correspondence with the EUROAIRNET classes for the 72 stations reveals that the proposed scheme is only dependent on the impact of combustion sources and not on climatic or orographic aspects. It is demonstrated that this classification is robust since in 87\% of the occasions the classification obtained for individual years coincide with the global classification obtained for the 1998–2012 period. Finally, case studies showing the applicability of the new classification scheme for assessing the impact on O3 of a station relocation and performing a critical evaluation of an air quality monitoring network are also presented.},

Compared to reference measurements, gas sensors would allow air pollution monitoring at a lower cost. The Directive allows using indicative measurements without restriction in the zones where the upper assessment threshold (UAT) is not exceeded while they permit a reduction of 50 \% of the minimum reference measurements where the UAT is exceeded. The Directive does not specify any indicative method but it requires to demonstrate that they can meet a data quality objective (DQO) that is about twice less stringent than the one of reference methods. The DQO is defined as a relative expanded uncertainty. Since the Directive does not give any guidance for this demonstration, within MACPoll it has been decided to draft a protocol for the evaluation of gas sensors.},

	abstract = {Measurements at appropriate spatial and temporal scales are essential for understanding and monitoring spatially heterogeneous environments with complex and highly variable emission sources, such as in urban areas. However, the costs and complexity of conventional air quality measurement methods means that measurement networks are generally extremely sparse. In this paper we show that miniature, low-cost electrochemical gas sensors, traditionally used for sensing at parts-per-million (ppm) mixing ratios can, when suitably configured and operated, be used for parts-per-billion (ppb) level studies for gases relevant to urban air quality. Sensor nodes, in this case consisting of multiple individual electrochemical sensors, can be low-cost and highly portable, thus allowing the deployment of scalable high-density air quality sensor networks at fine spatial and temporal scales, and in both static and mobile configurations.

In this paper we provide evidence for the performance of electrochemical sensors at the parts-per-billion level, and then outline results obtained from deployments of networks of sensor nodes in both an autonomous, high-density, static network in the wider Cambridge (UK) area, and as mobile networks for quantification of personal exposure. Examples are presented of measurements obtained with both highly portable devices held by pedestrians and cyclists, and static devices attached to street furniture. The widely varying mixing ratios reported by this study confirm that the urban environment cannot be fully characterised using sparse, static networks, and that measurement networks with higher resolution (both spatially and temporally) are required to quantify air quality at the scales which are present in the urban environment. We conclude that the instruments described here, and the low-cost/high-density measurement philosophy which underpins it, have the potential to provide a far more complete assessment of the high-granularity air quality structure generally observed in the urban environment, and could ultimately be used for quantification of human exposure as well as for monitoring and legislative purposes.},

The study assessed if the sensors were could reach the Data Quality Objective (DQOs) of the European Air Quality Directive for indicative methods (between 25 and 30\% of uncertainty for O3 and NO2). In this study it appears that O3 may be calibrated using simple regression techniques while for NO2 a better agreement between sensors and reference measurements was reached using supervised learning techniques. The hourly O3 DQO was met while it was unlikely that NO2 hourly one could be met. This was likely caused by the low NO2 levels correlated with high O3 levels that are typical of semi-rural site where the measurements of this study took place.},

Based on the results of evaluation and validation of low-costs sensors carried out during the first part of the project, several sensors have been grouped in a clustered system able to detect NO/NO2/NOx, CO, SO2 and O3 which are pollutants regulated in 2008/50/EEC). To extend the range of species, CO2 sensors and PM2.5 and PM10 personal aerosol monitor have been added.

The cluster consists of 3 NO2 sensors and 2 CO sensors, both electrochemical and metal oxide type, 1 NO and 2 O3 electrochemical sensors, 2 infrared CO2 sensors and 1 PM2.5 and 1 PM10 laser photometers. Experiment is carried out with the collaboration of the ERLAP Laboratory at an air conditioned mobile laboratory equipped with meteorological sensors and reference gas analyzers. These reference measurements are used for data validation, comparison and data treatment of sensor responses. 

Based on the outcome of the procedure of evaluation and calibration  and the single reports of validation, both performances and interfering parameters of such a cluster are investigated using deterministic or statistical methods such as discriminant analysis and neural networks.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}This work applied inexpensive passive sampling to measure airborne coarse particles with aerodynamic diameters between 2.5 and 10 [mu]m (PM10-2.5) over three 7-day periods at 33 sites in a medium-sized Midwest City (Iowa City, IA). The number of sites and their locations were selected using an optimal sampling design that captured 95\% of the total variance in PM10-2.5 as measured with real-time sampling equipment on a mobile sampling platform. Weekly averages of PM10-2.5 were 15.9 [mu]g m-3 (coefficient of variation between sites, CV=23\%), 17.9 [mu]g m-3 (CV=24\%), and 6.1 [mu]g m-3 (CV=30\%). ANOVA showed that these means were statistically different (p{\textless}0.001), and that the spatial variability plus random error accounted for 29\% of the total variability. The maximum coefficient of divergence between sites--a relative measure of uniformity--ranged from 0.21 to 0.36. These values indicate that PM10-2.5 was heterogeneous even on the fine spatial resolution studied in this work (average distance between sites was 4.4 km). The spatial patterns of PM10-2.5 measured with the passive samplers closely matched with those of mobile mapping and corresponded with known coarse particle sources in the area. This work demonstrates that passive sampling coupled with effective sampling design may enhance our ability to assess exposure to PM10-2.5 at a local scale. Compared to exposure estimates made with data from centrally located, filter-based samplers, these highly spatially resolved estimates should reduce exposure misclassification errors in epidemiological studies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The variogram is central to any geostatistical survey, but the precision of a variogram estimated from sample data by the method of moments is unknown. It is important to be able to quantify variogram uncertainty to ensure that the variogram estimate is sufficiently accurate for kriging. In previous studies theoretical expressions have been derived to approximate uncertainty in both estimates of the experimental variogram and fitted variogram models. These expressions rely upon various statistical assumptions about the data and are largely untested. They express variogram uncertainty as functions of the sampling positions and the underlying variogram. Thus the expressions can be used to design efficient sampling schemes for estimating a particular variogram. Extensive simulation tests show that for a Gaussian variable with a known variogram, the expression for the uncertainty of the experimental variogram estimate is accurate. In practice however, the variogram of the variable is unknown and the fitted variogram model must be used instead. For sampling schemes of 100 points or more this has only a small effect on the accuracy of the uncertainty estimate. The theoretical expressions for the uncertainty of fitted variogram models generally overestimate the precision of fitted parameters. The uncertainty of the fitted parameters can be determined more accurately by simulating multiple experimental variograms and fitting variogram models to these. The tests emphasize the importance of distinguishing between the variogram of the field being surveyed and the variogram of the random process which generated the field. These variograms are not necessarily identical. Most studies of variogram uncertainty describe the uncertainty associated with the variogram of the random process. Generally however, it is the variogram of the field being surveyed which is of interest. For intensive sampling schemes, estimates of the field variogram are significantly more precise than estimates of the random process variogram. It is important, when designing efficient sampling schemes or fitting variogram models, that the appropriate expression for variogram uncertainty is applied.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the results of an intercomparison exercise for the determination of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni) and lead (Pb) in PM10, which are regulated by the European Directives for ambient air quality. Thirteen laboratories participated, generally using the European reference methods of measurement which consist of a microwave digestion followed by analysis with either ICP-MS or GF-AAS. Each participant was asked to analyse five test samples: a liquid Certified Reference Material (CRM), two sub-samples of a NIST dust CRM (one already digested and one to be digested by the participants) and two loaded filters (one already digested and one to be digested by the participants).
Participants were able to meet the Data Quality Objectives (DQOs) of the European Directives (expanded uncertainties of 25 \% for Pb and 40 \% for As, Cd and Ni) for 93 \% of all test samples, except for the loaded filter that were digested by the participants. In fact, only 76 \% of DQOs were met for this test sample, the closest to a routine sample analysis in the laboratory. The difficulties in analysing this test sample came mainly from digestion and contamination processes. Satisfactory results were also obtained using other digestion techniques (Soxhlet extraction and high pressure methods) and analytical methods (ICP-OES for Cd, Ni and Pb, EDXRF for Pb and Ni and Voltammetry for As, Ni, and Pb).
Participants claimed uncertainties of about 10 \% for Pb and between 15 and 20 \% for As, Cd and Ni. These uncertainties were confirmed for 77 \% of results. The reproducibility of the methods of measurement was between 41 and 54 \% while repeatability remained between 5 and 12 \% except for the analysis of As on filters which was up to 20 \%. The majority of participant results showed higher between-day variability (14 ± 11 \%) than within-day variability (6.0 ± 5.3 \%).},

The sampling component represents the dominant contribution of the measurement uncertainty with a sampling uncertainty to measurement uncertainty ratio ranging between 0.6 and 0.9.

	abstract = {The spatial heterogeneity of measured data from contaminated sites is a serious problem with regard to
uncertainty and risk assessment. Stochastic simulation permits the generation of several realizations of
the spatial data distribution without aiming to minimise local error variance (as in kriging, for example),
but retaining important statistics such as the histogram, the semivariogram, and the measured data. The
nugget-to-sill ratio will, however, inﬂuence spatial data interpolation based on geostatistical models. The
nugget effect is generally unknown to the investigator and inﬂuenced by the sampling density and sam-
pling grid, as well as by complex geological settings, analytical errors, or an unknown small-scale site-
speciﬁc contaminant input. Using simulated annealing to generate 30 randomly combined input data
realizations and a simple transport model, we can show that the modeled zinc discharge is up to 70\%
higher if the nugget-to-sill ratio is varied by a factor of two times. The variance of zinc discharge was
inﬂuenced by the nugget-to-sill ratio by a factor of 10 times. By reducing the number of drill holes to
one half from the data set at random we have shown that the variance of the reduced data set did not
provide a reliable prediction of the data heterogeneity for the complete data set, and the mean zinc dis-
charge was up to 170\% higher when only half of the drill holes were considered. Uncertainty analysis
based on equal-probability realizations should further be founded by additional variation of nugget-to-
sill ratio within a reasonable spectrum.},

The network consists of 20 monitoring stations within an area of , which encompasses a major industrial and power generation centre in the midst of a population of about 500 000. The pollutants' spatial features agree well with their known sources and the expected dispersion by the prevailing meteorology. The ranking of their spatial variations agree with published observations on larger spatial scales. The high-resolution maps capture in a small spatial scale the NOx and O3 cycle relationships expected by theory, and previously observed by analyses of monitoring time series. High correlation was found between the spatial patterns of the PM10, NOx and O3, whereas the correlation between the spatial features of the PM10 and SO2 is low. This suggests that the traffic, a major source of NOx, rather than industry, the major source of SO2, is the main contributor to the anthropogenic PM10 in the study area. This inference is corroborated by the low sulphur to nitrogen ratio throughout the region, which is typical of traffic-dominated pollution. A general conclusion drawn from this study is that high-resolution monitoring and mapping can significantly contribute to air quality management programmes in terms of both pollution abatement and exposure and risk assessment.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

been established to perform this task. In the Netherlands the National Radioactivity Monitoring network (NRM) was installed. Currently, point maps are used to interpret the data from the NRM. Automatically generating maps in real-time would improve the interpretation of the data by giving the user a clear overview of the present radiological situation and provide an estimate of the 
radioactivity level at unmeasured locations. In this paper we present a prototype system that automatically generates real-time maps of radioactivity levels and 
presents results in an interoperable way through a Web Map Service. The system defines a first step towards  a emergency management system and is suited primarily for data without large outliers. The automatic interpolation is done using universal kriging in combination with an automatic variogram fitting procedure. The focus is on mathematical and operational issues and on architectural considerations on how to improve the interoperability and portability of the prototype system.},

This study was conducted to a) assess the feasibility of large-scale kriging estimations of daily residential-level ambient PM concentrations, b) perform and compare cross-validations of different kriging models, c) contrast three popular kriging approaches, and d ) calculate SE of the kriging estimations. We used PM data for PM with aerodynamic diameter ≤10 μm (PM10) and aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5) from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for the year 2000. Kriging estimations were performed at 94,135 geocoded addresses of Women’s Health Initiative study participants using the ArcView geographic information system. We developed a semiautomated program to enable large-scale daily kriging estimation and assessed validity of semivariogram models using prediction error (PE), standardized prediction error (SPE), root mean square standardized (RMSS), and SE of the estimated PM. National- and regional-scale kriging performed satisfactorily, with the former slightly better. The average PE, SPE, and RMSS of daily PM10 semivariograms using regular ordinary kriging with a spherical model were 0.0629, −0.0011, and 1.255 μg/m3, respectively; the average SE of the estimated residential-level PM10 was 27.36 μg/m3. The values for PM2.5 were 0.049, 0.0085, 1.389, and 4.13 μg/m3, respectively. Lognormal ordinary kriging yielded a smaller average SE and effectively eliminated out-of-range predicted values compared to regular ordinary kriging. Semiautomated daily kriging estimations and semivariogram cross-validations are feasible on a national scale. Lognormal ordinary kriging with a spherical model is valid for estimating daily ambient PM at geocoded residential addresses.},

	abstract = {Tropospheric ozone (O3) and particulate matter (PM) are pollutants of great concern to air quality managers. Federal standards for these pollutants have been promulgated in recent years because of the known adverse effects of the pollutants on human health, the environment, and visibility. Local meteorological conditions exert a strong influence over day-to-day variations in pollutant concentrations; therefore, the meteorological signal must be removed in order for air quality planners and managers to examine underlying emissions-related trends and make better air quality management decisions for the future. Although the Kolmogorov-Zurbenko (KZ) filter has been widely used for this type of trend separation in O3 studies in the eastern United States, this article aims to extend the method in three key ways. First, whereas the KZ filter is known as a useful tool for O3 analysis, this study also evaluates its effectiveness when applied to PM. Second, the method was applied to Tucson, AZ, a city in the semi-arid southwestern United States (Southwest), to evaluate the appropriateness of the method in a region with weaker synoptic weather controls on air quality than the eastern United States. Third, additional forms of output were developed and tailored to be more applicable to decision-makers' needs through a partnership between academic researchers and air quality planners and managers. Results of the study indicate that the KZ filter is a useful method for examining emissions-related PM trends, resulting in small, but potentially significant, differences after adjustment. For the Tucson situation with weaker synoptic controls, the KZ method identified mixing height as a more important variable than has been found in other cities.},

	abstract = {The paper presents some contemporary approaches to spatial environmental data analysis. The main topics are concentrated on the decision-oriented problems of environmental spatial data mining and modeling: valorization and representativity of data with the help of exploratory data analysis, spatial predictions, probabilistic and risk mapping, development and application of conditional stochastic simulation models. The innovative part of the paper presents integrated/hybrid model—machine learning (ML) residuals sequential simulations—MLRSS. The models are based on multilayer perceptron and support vector regression ML algorithms used for modeling long-range spatial trends and sequential simulations of the residuals. ML algorithms deliver non-linear solution for the spatial non-stationary problems, which are difficult for geostatistical approach. Geostatistical tools (variography) are used to characterize performance of ML algorithms, by analyzing quality and quantity of the spatially structured information extracted from data with ML algorithms. Sequential simulations provide efficient assessment of uncertainty and spatial variability. Case study from the Chernobyl fallouts illustrates the performance of the proposed model. It is shown that probability mapping, provided by the combination of ML data driven and geostatistical model based approaches, can be efficiently used in decision-making process.},

	abstract = {Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (EDXRF) was compared to Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) for the measurements of elements (Mg, Al, Si, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Cu, Zn, As, Br, Sr, Pb, Mo, Cd, Sn and Sb) in particulate matter (PM10) collected on Teflon and two types of quartz filters at different sites. Two different methods of EDXRF analysis, linear calibration and standardless analysis, were studied. For the linear calibration, Pb, Mn, Fe, Cu, Ti and Zn were found to be site and filter type independent whereas Ca was only site independent. The site effect was evidenced for K, As, Ni, and V for quartz filter. The standardless EDXRF analysis showed better results than linear calibrations except for As, Co and V for Teflon filters and Cr and V for quartz filters. The measurement uncertainty of standardless EDXRF analysis was estimated by establishing a model equation. The measurement uncertainty estimated with this model equation was confirmed by field experiments provided that elemental masses exceeded observed thresholds. It was found that standardless EDXRF analysis is able to quantify most of the elements studied, particularly on Teflon filters rather than quartz filters. The standardless EDXRF analysis complies with the data quality objectives (DQO) of European Directives to measure Pb in PM10 for three types of filters, even at concentrations lower than limit values (LV). The detection limits (MDL) of standardless EDXRF analysis for measuring As and Cd were found to be insufficient to meet the legislative requirements. The MDL of Ni was sufficiently low for measurements; however, measurement uncertainties remained higher than the DQO at the lower concentrations than LV.},

	abstract = {The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s PM2.5 Chemical Speciation Network (CSN) and the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) network use X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis to quantify trace elements in samples of fine particles less than 2.5 microns in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5). Methods for calculating uncertainty values for XRF results vary considerably among laboratories and instrument makes and models. To support certain types of modeling and data analysis, uncertainty estimates are required that are consistent within and between monitoring programs, and that are independent of the laboratories that performed the analyses and the analytical instrumentation used. The goal of this work was to develop a consensus model for uncertainties associated with XRF analysis of PM2.5 filter samples. The following important components of uncertainty are included in the model described herein: variability in peak area, calibration, field sampling, and attenuation of X-ray intensity for light elements. This paper includes a detailed analysis of how attenuation uncertainties for light elements are derived. For the remaining uncertainty components included in the model, an approach and recommendations are presented to ensure that laboratories performing this type of analysis can use similar equations and parameterizations. By applying this uniform approach, it is illustrated how the uncertainties reported by the CSN and IMPROVE network laboratories can be brought into very good agreement. The proposed method is best applied at the time of data generation, but retrospective estimation of uncertainties in existing data-sets is also possible. This paper serves to document the equations used for calculating the uncertainties in speciated PM2.5 data currently being posted on EPA's Air Quality System database for the PM2.5 CSN program.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Hazardous chemicals escape to the environment by a number of natural and/or anthropogenic activities and may cause adverse effects on human health and the environment. Increased combustion of fossil fuels in the last century is responsible for the progressive change in the atmospheric composition. Air pollutants, such as carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), ozone (O3), heavy metals, and respirable particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), differ in their chemical composition, reaction properties, emission, time of disintegration and ability to diffuse in long or short distances. Air pollution has both acute and chronic effects on human health, affecting a number of different systems and organs. It ranges from minor upper respiratory irritation to chronic respiratory and heart disease, lung cancer, acute respiratory infections in children and chronic bronchitis in adults, aggravating pre-existing heart and lung disease, or asthmatic attacks. In addition, short- and long-term exposures have also been linked with premature mortality and reduced life expectancy. These effects of air pollutants on human health and their mechanism of action are briefly discussed. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The best solutions were found to be six factors for elemental compositions of each of the fine and coarse particulate matter fractions at the urban site and five factors each for both fine and coarse fractions at the suburban location. Soil was the major source of airborne particulate matter identified for all data sets. The motor vehicle factor showed much higher concentration for Br in urban than in suburban area. A motorcycle factor with high concentrations of Zn and Mn were found at the urban site. The factor containing highest concentrations of Na and Cl was attributed to sea-salt and was clearly seen in the urban atmosphere. The site was located 35 km to the north from the Gulf of Thailand and was influenced by wind from the south and southwest for most of the year. Charcoal/wood burning and incineration factors were likely to be the local sources. A factor with high concentration of Ca was attributed to a construction near the urban residential site and from two plaster manufacturing factories close to the suburban residential site.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Empirical calibration curves comparing intensities with concentrations can be used for the analysis of samples with limited variations of the matrix composition. However, a general-purpose calibration procedure that is applicable to a larger variety of matrix types and covering wider ranges of the analyte concentration is usually more desirable. This paper presents practical and simple calibration procedures for the determination of major and trace elements that will allow one to adapt any mathematical model to any set of experimental data while producing the maximum of accuracy in the final results. It is also shown how to calculate from multi-element standards a practical intensity of the pure analyte, thus eliminating the requirement for a pure analyte specimen.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Objection: To study the pollution of atmospheric particles at winter in Beijing and compare the lung toxicity which induced by particle samples from different sampling sites. Method: We collected samples from two sampling points during the winter for toxicity testing and chemical analysis. Wistar rats were administered with particles by intratracheal instillation. After exposure, biochemically index, esimmunity indexes, histopathology and DNA damage were detected in rat pulmonary cells. Result: The elements with enrichment factors (EF) larger than 10 were As, Cd, Cu, Zn, S and Pb in the four experiment groups. The priority control of the total concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in PM10 and PM2.5 of Near-traffic source was much higher than that of Far-traffic source, it demonstrated that near the traffic source of PAHs pollution was heavier than that of Far-traffic source, as it was close to main roads Beiyuan Road, motor vehicle emissions were much higher. The pathology of lung showed that the degree of inflammation was increased with the particle diameter minished, it was the same as the detection of biochemical parameters such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Total antioxidant status(T-AOC) and total protein (TP) in BALF and inflammation cytokine(interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) in lung homogenate. The indexes of DNA damage including the content of DNA and Olive empennage of PM2.5 were significant higher than that of PM10 at the same surveillance point (P \&lt; 0.05), near-traffic particles were higher than the far-traffic particles at the same diameter, (P \&lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Near-traffic area particles had certain pollution at winter in Beijing. Meanwhile, atmospheric particulate matters on lung toxicity were related to the particles size and distance related sites which were exposed: smaller size, more toxicity; nearer from traffic, more toxicity. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

During the sampling period a new active carbon packed-bed reactor was installed for further cleaning of the stack gases. A reduction by a factor of 10 for most elements was observed. Because of their resistance to hot (150°C) and corrosive gases, quartz fibre filters were used for sampling the emitted aerosols. The aerosol-loaded filters were analysed using an X-lab XRF-spectrometer (Spectro A.I.) calibrated with laboratory-developed standard filters. In the future, a combined sampling and analysis system for continuous emission control, planned together with Spectro A.I.

It is against this background that the air particulate samples collected on using PM10 samplers are analysed to determine the elemental concentrations. Each sample was divided into four quadrants and each was analysed under same conditions to determine if the particles were deposited uniformly over the filter. Each analysis was done using EDXRF technique. The spectrometer consists of four secondary targets, which are automatically switched to in sequence in analysing each sample. The concentration of various elements detected was determined using TURBOQUANT (a brand name for a SPECTRO method which is used for screening analysis). Sixteen elements were detected in every sample. Results show that there was less than 10\% deviation in the concentrations in different quadrants. There were a few elements like Ba, Cs, etc., which have deviation greater than 20\%. The concentrations of these latter elements were close to detection limits of the spectrometer. We conclude that the analytical result of particulate samples deposited on filters by the PM10 sampler can be reliable in terms of the homogeneity of the deposition. For such analytes with low concentrations, it would be important that the sampling time be increased to allow for higher mass deposition on the filter.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The aim of this article is to review progress toward integration of toxicological and epidemiological research results concerning the role of specific physicochemical properties, and associated sources, in the adverse impact of ambient particulate matter (PM) on public health. Contemporary knowledge about atmospheric aerosols indicates their complex and variable nature. This knowledge has influenced toxicological assessments, pointing to several possible properties of concern, including particle size and specific inorganic and organic chemical constituents. However, results from controlled exposure laboratory studies are difficult to relate to actual community health results because of ambiguities in simulated PM mixtures, inconsistent concentration measurements, and the wide range of different biological endpoints. The use of concentrated ambient particulates (CAPs) coupled with factor analysis has provided an improved understanding of biological effects from more realistic laboratory-based exposure studies. Epidemiological studies have provided information concerning sources of potentially toxic particles or components, adding insight into the significance of exposure to secondary particles, such as sulfate, compared with primary emissions, such as elemental and organic carbon from transportation sources. Recent epidemiological approaches incorporate experimental designs that take advantage of broadened speciation monitoring, multiple monitoring stations, source proximity designs, and emission intervention. However, there continue to be major gaps in knowledge about the relative toxicity of particles from various sources, and the relationship between toxicity and particle physicochemical properties. Advancing knowledge could be facilitated with cooperative toxicological and epidemiological study designs, with the support of findings from atmospheric chemistry.

	abstract = {X-ray fluorescence spectrometry due to its nondestructive nature is widely applied in analysis of single layers and multiple layer films (e.g. semiconductors, electrooptic and solar cell devices, coatings, corrosion and paint layers), individual particles (airborne, fly ash, gunshot residue particles, etc.), art and archeological objects (manuscripts, paintings, icons) and many others. Quantitative analysis of these materials, frequently classified as samples of less than infinite thickness (thin or intermediate-thickness samples), required applying adequate matrix correction methods taking into account complex dependence of analyte fluorescent radiation intensity on full matrix composition and sample thickness. In this article, the matrix correction methods including fundamental parameters, Monte Carlo simulations, influence coefficients algorithms and methods based on X-ray transmission measurements are reviewed.
The difficulties in the analysis of single layer and multiple layer films and the accuracy of fundamental parameter methods in simultaneous determination of their thickness and composition are discussed. The quantitative analysis of individual particles and inhomogeneous and/or complex structure materials using fundamental parameter and Monte Carlo simulation methods in micro-beam X-ray fluorescence spectrometry are also reviewed. Some references are devoted to the analysis of light matrix samples, e.g. geological, environmental and biological samples, in which undetectable low-Z elements are present (so-called [`]dark matrix') using backscattered fundamental parameter methods.
Since the samples of less than infinite thickness are partially transparent for X-ray beams, the transmission measurements present possibilities that are unattainable for bulk samples. Thus, the emission-transmission method and also new instruments allowing measurements of the primary X-ray beam transmitted through the sample together with measurements of X-ray fluorescence intensities in transmission and reflection geometry are reviewed.},

In this paper a combination of measurements and modelling is used to assess the contribution from road traffic emissions. Concentrations of particulate heavy metals in air were measured simultaneously during 1 year at a densely trafficked street and at an urban background site in Stockholm, Sweden. Annual mean concentrations of cadmium were 50 times lower than the EU directive and for nickel and arsenic concentrations were 10 and six times lower, respectively. More than a factor of two higher concentrations was in general observed at the street in comparison to roof levels indicating the strong influence from local road traffic emissions. The only compound with a significantly decreasing trend in the urban background was Pb with 9.1 ng m-3 in 1995/96 compared to 3.4 ng m-3 2003/04. This is likely due to decreased emissions from wear of brake linings and reduced emissions due to oil and coal combustion in central Europe.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}Total road traffic emission factors for heavy metals were estimated using parallel measurements of NOx concentrations and knowledge of NOx emission factors. In general, the emission factors for the street were higher than reported in road tunnel measurements. This could partly be due to different driving conditions, since especially for metals which are mainly emitted from brake wear, more stop and go driving in the street compared to in road tunnels is likely to increase emissions. Total emissions were compared with exhaust emissions, obtained from the COPERT model and brake wear emissions based on an earlier study in Stockholm. For Cu, Ni and Zn the sum of brake wear and exhaust emissions agreed very well with estimated total emission factors in this study. More than 90\% of the road traffic emissions of Cu were due to brake wear. For Ni more than 80\% is estimated to be due to exhaust emissions and for Zn around 40\% of road traffic emissions are estimated to be due to exhaust emissions. Pb is also mainly due to exhaust emissions (90\%); a fuel Pb content of only 0.5 mg L-1 would give similar emission factor as that based on the concentration increment at the street. This is the first study using simultaneous measurements of heavy metals at street and roof enabling calculations of emission factors using a tracer technique.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

From the analytical point of view, beam damage is one of the most important problems due to its big impact on the analysis of individual atmospheric particles. The dependence of the beam-damage effect on the type of collection substrate was studied using standard aerosol particles. Different metallic substrates were rigorously tested in relation to the beam damage effects to different kinds of beam sensitive particles. Ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, sodium nitrate as well as sulfuric acid droplets were analyzed using a liquid nitrogen cooled sample stage on different metallic substrates such as Be, Al, Si and Ag. The obtained results confirm that the use of Be as a collection surface offers some advantages in order to minimize the damage to beam sensitive particles, as suggested in earlier research.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The collected PM10 24-h samples were analyzed for nine toxic metals and metalloids (Pb, As, Cd, Ni, Cr, Mn, V, Cu, Hg). Concerning the five elements regulated by the European Union, annual average concentrations of Pb were found below the limit values at all sites, Cd and Ni concentrations were lower than the prospective assessment thresholds at all sites, concentrations of As exceeded the assessment threshold at two sites, while concentrations of Hg were found below detection limits in all samples. Concentration levels of Mn and V were in compliance with the values proposed by the World Health Organization. The seasonal and spatial variability of metal concentrations was examined and site-specific correlation analysis was conducted for the identification of metals with similar origin. The association between trace metals and NOx concentrations was explored to account for the impact of automotive sources, at two traffic-impacted sites. Cu was the metal most closely linked with the road transport sector. The relation of concentration levels with the prevalence of winds from different sectors was studied in an effort to investigate the transport of metal particles from various zones of the city. Finally, factor analysis was carried out to extract the main components responsible for the variance of the dataset and to attribute them to specific source categories, with vehicle-related sources being important in all cases.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

To measure such low concentrations represents a challenge for chemical and physical analysis. In this study, ambient aerosol was collected in Zürich (Switzerland) in 1-h intervals and three size fractions (aerodynamic diameters 0.1−1 μm, 1−2.5 μm, and 2.5−10 μm), using a three-stage rotating drum impactor (RDI). The samples were analyzed by energy-dispersive Synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (SR-XRF) to obtain size-segregated hourly elemental aerosol mass concentrations for Cr, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Br, and Pb, along with S, Cl, and Ca under the selected experimental conditions. The high sensitivity of SR-XRF allowed for detection limits of {\textless}50 pg/m3 for most of the above elements, with a net analysis time of only 15 s per sample. The data obtained with this technique illustrate that there is a considerable gain of relevant information when time resolution for measurements is increased from 1 day to 1 h. The individual size fractions of a specific element may show significantly different short-term patterns.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}Factors and sources affecting measurement uncertainty associated with monitoring metals in airborne particulate matter (PM) were investigated as part of the Windsor, Ontario Exposure Assessment Study (WOEAS). The assessment was made using co-located duplicate samples and a comparison of two analytical approaches: ED-XRF and ICP-MS. Sampling variability was estimated using relative percent difference (RPD) of co-located duplicate samples. The comparison of ICP-MS and ED-XRF results yields very good correlations (R2 {\textgreater}= 0.7) for elements present at concentrations that pass both ICP-MS and ED-XRF detection limits (e.g. Fe, Mn, Zn, Pb and Cu). PM concentration ranges (median, sample number) of 24-h indoor PM10 and personal PM10 filters, and outdoor PM2.5 filters were determined to be 2.2-40.7 (11.0, n = 48) [mu]g m-3, 8.0-48.3 (11.9, n = 48) [mu]g m-3, and 17.1-42.3 (21.6, n = 18) [mu]g m-3, respectively. The gravimetric analytical results reveal that the variations in PM mass measurements for same-day sampling are insignificant compared to temporal or spatial variations: 92\%, 100\% and 96\% of indoor, outdoor and personal duplicate samples, respectively, pass the quality criteria (RPD {\textless}= 20\%). Uncertainties associated with ED-XRF elemental measurements of S, Ca, Mn, Fe and Zn for 24-h filter samples are low: 78\%-100\% of the duplicate samples passed the quality criteria. In the case of 24-h filter samples using ICP-MS, more elements passed the quality criteria due to the lower detection limits. These were: Li, Na, K, Ca, Si, Al, V, Fe, Mn, Co, Cu, Mo, Ag, Zn, Pb, As, Mg, Sb, Sn, Sr, Th, Ti, Tl, and U. Low air concentrations of metals (near or below instrumental detection limits) and/or inadvertent introduction of metal contamination are the main causes for excluding elements based on the pass/fail criteria. Uncertainty associated with elemental measurements must be assessed on an element-by-element basis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The correction model and the influence coefficient introduced in this paper have clear and definite physical meanings. They gave satisfactory results when utilized in analyzing stainless-steel samples. The results also indicate that the e†ect of tertiary fluorescence cannot be neglected in some cases.

Sampling was performed at sites in southwestern (Stockton, NY) and northern New York (Potsdam, NY) where these materials may be transported into the New York from the central United States and from Canada. The data from these measurements were used in paired receptor models to assess the origins of the measured concentrations. Factor analysis in the form of positive matrix factorization (PMF) was used to obtain information about possible sources of the aerosol. Six and seven sources were resolved from Stockton and Potsdam sites, respectively. Six of the sources are common to the two sites in these two summers. They are secondary sulfate, secondary nitrate, soil, wood smoke, zinc smelter and copper smelter. A nickel smelter source is also resolved at Potsdam. Potential source contribution function (PSCF) analysis which combines the aerosol data with the air parcel backward trajectories was applied to identify possible source areas and pathways from these sources at the two sites. The combination of the two receptor modeling methods, PMF and PSCF, provides an effective way in identifying atmospheric aerosol sources and their likely locations. Emissions from different anthropogenic activities as well as secondary aerosol production are the main source measured in Potsdam and Stockton.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Ultraﬁne particle (UFP) number concentrations vary signiﬁcantly on small spatial and temporal scales due to their short atmospheric lifetimes and multiplicity of sources. To determine UFP exposure gradients within a community, simultaneous particle number concentration measurements at a network of sites are necessary. Concurrent particle number size distribution measurements aid in identifying UFP sources, while providing data to investigate local scale effects of both photochemical and physical processes on UFP. From April to December 2007, we monitored particle number size distributions at 13 sites within 350 m–11 km of each other in the vicinity of the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach using Scanning Mobility Particle Sizers (SMPS). Typically, three SMPS units were simultaneously deployed and rotated among sites at 1–2 week intervals. Total particle number concentration measurements were conducted continuously at all sites. Seasonal and diurnal number size distribution patterns are complex, highly dependent on local meteorology, nearby PM sources, and times of day, and cannot be generalized over the study area nor inferred from one or two sampling locations. Spatial variation in particle number size distributions was assessed by calculating the coefﬁcient of divergence (COD) and correlation coefﬁcients (r) between site pairs. Results show an overall inverse relationship between particle size and CODs, implying that number concentrations of smaller particles ({\textless}40 nm) differ from site to site, whereas larger particles tend to have similar concentrations at various sampling locations. In addition, variations in r values as a function of particle size are not necessarily consistent with corresponding COD values, indicating that using results from correlation analysis alone may not accurately assess spatial variability.},
