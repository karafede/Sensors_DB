We first report on the fabrication and characterization of gas sensors using a back-gated field-effect transistor platform with chemically reduced graphene oxide (R-GO) as the conducting channel. These sensors exhibited a 360\% increase in response when exposed to 100 ppm NO2 in air, compared with thermally reduced graphene oxide sensors we reported earlier. We then present a new method of signal processing/data interpretation that addresses (i) sensing devices with long recovery periods (such as required for sensing gases with these R-GO sensors) as well as (ii) device-to-device variations. A theoretical analysis is used to illuminate the importance of using the new signal processing method when the sensing device suffers from slow recovery and non-negligible contact resistance. We suggest that the work reported here (including the sensor signal processing method and the inherent simplicity of device fabrication) is a significant step toward the real-world application of graphene-based chemical sensors.

The sensor array consists of gas-sensing materials with SnO2 as the base material and a platinum heater and is fabricated using silk printing methods on an alumina substrate. The sensors show a high and broad sensitivity and reproducibility to low concentrations based on the use of nano-sized sensing materials with different additives. Utilizing the sensing signals of the array, an artificial neural network with an error-back-propagation learning algorithm is then implemented as a recognition system for classifying and quantifying the VOCs. Simulation and experimental results demonstrated that the proposed gas sensor array with the neural network was effective in recognizing various kinds and quantities of VOCs.},

For this reason, it is fundamental to identify the nature of the adsorbed species resulting from the interaction of NO and NO2 with the tin oxide surface. This aspect has been studied in literature by Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD). To state more precisely structures of adsorbed species, we link TPD with Diffuse Reflectance Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS). Concerning NO2 adsorption, DRIFTS experiments indicate the formation of monodentate nitrato species at room temperature. By increasing the temperature, a conversion of adsorbed species is observed. The nature of surface groups is discussed. In the presence of hydroxyl groups (two different OH groups are evidenced), the formation of hydrogeno nitrates is detected.},

	abstract = {Epitaxial graphene grown on SiC substrate is one of the most promising methods for achieving large area uniform graphene films. Our experimental results demonstrate graphene layers grown on both Si and C-faces of semi-insulating 6H-SiC can offer very high detection sensitivity, selectivity, and fast response time. Exposure to only 500 ppb NO2 reduced the conductivity by 2.25\%, while 18 ppm caused a reduction of {\textasciitilde}10\%. In contrast, high concentration of commonly interfering gases, namely, CO2 (20\%), HζO (saturated vapor), NH3 (550 ppm), and pure O2 increased the conductivity by a maximum of only {\textasciitilde}2\%. Graphene on C-face of SiC resulted in somewhat lower sensitivity for the test gases, with the conductivity changing in opposite direction compared to Si-face for any particular gas. The conductance change due to molecular adsorption was compared to changes in surface work function (SWF) as well as the charge transfer between the adsorbed molecules and the graphene surface. Measurements conducted at higher temperature showed significantly larger change in conductivity and faster response time.},

To do this, a series of uniformly distributed, randomly aligned SWNT films were prepared via vacuum filtration from suspended HiPCO nanotubes and transferred to photolithography patterned silicon chips with high reproducibility and yield. The SWNT film density was optimized for detection of dimethyl methylphosphonate and ammonia at the percolation threshold range of nanotube electric conductance. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to polymerize seven different polymers in aqueous solutions and coat a thin layer onto optimized SWNT films. Polymer coated SWNT-based sensors were analyzed for selectivity for a variety of gases. Results indicate that the electropolymerization of different polymers onto nanotube surfaces can be a simple and promising way to obtain controlled, reliable, and modulated response for various analyte molecules.},

The electrical resistance, increasing in the presence of oxidising gases, is measured between two ohmic contacts. The second sensor is a thin film of copper phthalocyanine deposited by sublimation on an alumina substrate. The conductivity of the phthalocyanine layer increases in the presence of oxidising gases. Influence of NO2 and O3, especially at low concentration, is investigated. Influence of other parameters like operating temperature or interfering gases is also studied.

pollutant concentration quantification according to the kinetics of sensor response. Results of laboratory experiments for various NO2 and O3 concentrations, in the range of 10–200 ppb, illustrate the selectivity of CuPc sensors towards ozone, obtained by our methodology. We have shown that ozone selectivity is especially improved for short time of exposure (few minutes) and for phthalocyanine layer maintained at low temperature (80 -C). For optimal conditions, our microsystem exhibits a threshold lower than 10 ppb, a resolution lower than 10 ppb, and good reproducibility of measurements. Performances obtained in real urban atmosphere are satisfying to ensure real time evaluation of ozone
during several days. Long-term stability and the detection of NO2 by associating chemical filters to our microsystem will be also discussed.},

	abstract = {Graphene, a one-atom layer of graphite, possesses a unique two-dimensional structure and excellent mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties. Thus, it has been regarded as an important component for making various functional composite materials. Graphene can be prepared through physical, chemical and electrochemical approaches. Among them, chemical methods were tested to be effective for producing chemically converted graphene (CCG) from various precursors (such as graphite, carbon nanotubes, and polymers) in large scale and at low costs. Therefore, CCG is more suitable for synthesizing high-performance graphene based composites. In this progress report, we review the recent advancements in the studies of the composites of CCG and small molecules, polymers, inorganic nanoparticles or other carbon nanomaterials. The methodology for preparing CCG and its composites has been summarized. The applications of CCG-based functional composite materials are also discussed.},

	abstract = {The results presented in this paper are obtained using SnO2-based gas sensors as chromatographic detectors. The tests were performed during a temperature cycle consisting in steps of one week at 350, 400, 450 and 350 Â°C. The analysed gas samples were CO-air mixtures with CO concentration between 0 and 50 ppm. The advantages of the used experimental set-up are the stable ambient atmospheric conditions (the constant flow of the stable carrier gas) and the separation properties of the chromatographic column which compensate the intrinsic lack of selectivity of SnO2-based gas sensing layers; the chromatographic column separates the gas mixture into a time sequence, so the sensor receives the different gases at different moments. The compositions of the used eluent gas â€” O2 technical grade which also contains percents of N2 and about 40 ppm of CH4 â€” and of the analysed sample can be examined in the same experimental run of the response to O2, CH4 and CO because, when gases are present in the sample which are also present in the carrier gas, differences appear between the moments in the time sequence. It was found that the relative sensitivities to O2 and CH4 increase when the temperature increases; the relative sensitivity to CO decreases when the temperature increaes and is strongly influenced by the temperature cycle. Its value at 350 Â°C and 40 ppm is around 40\% before the cycle and around 16\% after. It was also found that after the period of heating at 450 Â°C, the conductance at 400 and 350 Â°C became an increasing function of time; for a week this process did not stop. Using the results listed above, an explanation is given: at 450 Â°C the characteristics of the surface of the sensing layer are modified by a new equilibrium of surface oxygen vacancies.},

More especially, we will focus on the behavior of these Schottky structures during and after their exposures to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3). In this context, two types of structures have been studied: the simple Schottky diodes and the more elaborated structures called pseudo-Schottky. These diodes are realized with Au or Pd as metals. First, we will describe samples preparation and electrical characterization of the two types of structures. Then, we will compare sensor responses of these different structures under NO2 and O3. Finally, to better understand the action of these gases on the sensitive layer (the Schottky contact), X-rays photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is performed to follow the evolution of the metallic layer. The poisoning effect of active sites, which appears after NO2 and O3 expositions, is illustrated by comparative study of the active layer before and after exposure.},

	abstract = {Even in the absence of interfering gases, the lack of stability in the response of SnO2-based gas sensors does not allow their use as measuring devices. The cause is the dependence of the conductance of the sensor, in the absence of the reducing gas, on ambient atmosphere conditions and on ageing. As a result, at the same value of the concentration of the reducing gas, the conductance of the sensor measured at different moments has different values. In this paper, based on previous calculations, a formula for conductance is derived: the parameters which depend on the ambient atmosphere conditions and on ageing, on one hand, and the sensor constants, on the other hand, are separated. Based on this formula a calibration curve, valuable at gas concentrations higher than 20 ppm, is proposed: the ratio between the conductance of the sensor in the presence of the reducing gas and the conductance in the presence of a known gas concentration versus the concentration of the reducing gas. The results obtained for C2H5OH and CO showed that during a week, using the proposed calibration curve, the errors in the measurements of the gas concentration were less than 7\%.},

Four multivariate (MVA) regression methods have been used: classical least squares (CLS), inverse least squares (ILS), principal component regression (PCR) and partial least squares (PLS). The PCA classification permitted to distinguish three families of VOCs: aliphatic and aromatic, chlorinated and oxygenated compounds. ANNs classification discriminated six VOCs gases with a success rate of 71\%. The best results from the multicomponent analysis were obtained for the ILS and PCR methods.},

The gas sensitive device is a thin n-type InP epitaxial layer grown on a semi-insulating InP substrate. The electrical resistance of the layer, measured between ohmic contacts, increases in the presence of oxidising gases, the most important variations occurring in NO2 and ozone-containing atmospheres. A complete study performed in laboratory at a moderate operating temperature of 80Â°C on the sensor exposed to nitrogen dioxide enabled to obtain a precise NO2 calibration curve. In an outdoor application, only NO2, ozone and humidity seem to act on the sensor resistance, confirming laboratory experiments. One of these devices was used to monitor air pollution in an urban atmosphere. The resistance changes were compared with the readings of a commercial analysing equipment. The results clearly show that the sensor resistance variation follow the total O3 and NO2 concentrations variation in air. Different operating methods are discussed for these type of sensors, depending on what of these two pollutants has to be measured.},

	abstract = {Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are a standard tool for establishing relationships between data in many real world problems, in the absence of a parametric model. In the last decade, they have often been used for analyzing data produced by arrays of chemical sensors [electronic noses (e-noses)]. Still, the central issue of controlling the complexity of an MLP for optimal generalization is frequently overlooked by chemical sensors practitioners causing incorrect or suboptimal results (over or underfitting). In this paper, we will: 1) present different ways of controlling the complexity of an MLP (model order selection, early stopping, and regularization); 2) shortly review the literature on complexity control, inside and outside the e-nose community; and 3) give examples of effective complexity control for two e-noses datasets of different size and learning difficulty. It will be shown that, if early stopping or regularization are adopted, overfitting is avoided whatever the number of hidden units (and, hence, network weights). Another issue tackled in this paper is the influence on the generalization error of the number of principal components over which data are projected (before being fed into the MLP). Simulations show that (test set) performance depends strongly on the number of principal components and that even components with less than 1\% of the global variance enhance classification.},

This work presents a probabilistic approach to the calibration of MOX gas sensors using Gaussian Processes (GP). The proposed approach estimates for every sensor measurement a probability distribution of the corresponding gas concentration, which enables the calculation of confidence intervals for the predicted concentrations. Being able to predict the uncertainty about the concentration related to a particular sensor response is particularly advantageous in OSS applications where typically many sources of uncertainty exist. The proposed approach has been tested with an experimental setup where an array of MOX sensors and a Photo Ionization Detector (PID) are placed downwind with respect to the gas source. The PID is used to obtain ground truth concentration measurements. Comparison with standard calibration methods demonstrate the advantage of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {Up-to-date information on urban air pollution is of great importance for environmental protection agencies to assess air quality and provide advice to the general public in a timely manner. In particular, ultrafine particles (UFPs) are widely spread in urban environments and may have a severe impact on human health. However, the lack of knowledge about the spatio-temporal distribution of UFPs hampers profound evaluation of these effects. In this paper, we analyze one of the largest spatially resolved UFP data set publicly available today containing over 50 million measurements. We collected the measurements throughout more than two years using mobile sensor nodes installed on top of public transport vehicles in the city of Zurich, Switzerland. Based on these data, we develop land-use regression models to create pollution maps with a high spatial resolution of 100 m × 100 m. We compare the accuracy of the derived models across various time scales and observe a rapid drop in accuracy for maps with sub-weekly temporal resolution. To address this problem, we propose a novel modeling approach that incorporates past measurements annotated with metadata into the modeling process. In this way, we achieve a 26\% reduction in the root-mean-square error–a standard metric to evaluate the accuracy of air quality models–of pollution maps with semi-daily temporal resolution. We believe that our findings can help epidemiologists to better understand the adverse health effects related to UFPs and serve as a stepping stone towards detailed real-time pollution assessment.},

The proposed circuit has been proved to be able to reveal more than five decades of resistance variation (about 1\% of relative error in the range 470 kΩ–50 GΩ) and, at the same time, to estimate the sensor parasitic capacitance (about 0.3 pF of estimation error in the range 0–33 pF). The fabricated integrated circuit has shown good performances in a wide range of environmental temperature (from −20 °C to 80 °C). The suitability for sensor applications has been proved by interfacing a high-value resistance MOX sensor and monitoring both the resistance and the parasitic capacitance values during a fast thermal transient of the sensor. Moreover, the front-end has been utilized, as an example, for the detection of hydrogen by means of a Figaro TGS 2600 sensor. An on/off modulation has been applied during the fluxing of two gas mixtures, constituted by both hydrogen and nitrogen, with a hydrogen concentration of 40 ppm and 80 ppm, respectively. Compared to other solutions presented in the literature, the implementation and fabrication as integrated circuit in a standard CMOS technology allows the whole interface to be considered as a simple and low-cost solution for wide-range resistive sensor arrays.},

	abstract = {Chemo-resistive transduction presents practical advantages for capturing the spatio-temporal and structural organization of chemical compounds dispersed in different human habitats. In an open sampling system, however, where the chemo-sensory elements are directly exposed to the environment being monitored, the identification and monitoring of chemical substances present a more difficult challenge due to the dispersion mechanisms of gaseous chemical analytes, namely diffusion, turbulence, and advection. The success of such actively changeable practice is influenced by the adequate implementation of algorithmically driven formalisms combined with the appropriate design of experimental protocols. On the basis of this functional joint-formulation, in this study we examine an innovative methodology based on the inhibitory processing mechanisms encountered in the structural assembly of the insect's brain, namely Inhibitory Support Vector Machine (ISVM) applied to training a sensor array platform and evaluate its capabilities relevant to odor detection and identification under complex environmental conditions. We generated — and made publicly available — an extensive and unique dataset with a chemical detection platform consisting of 72 conductometric metal-oxide based chemical sensors in a custom-designed wind tunnel test-bed facility to test our methodology. Our findings suggest that the aforementioned methodology can be a valuable tool to guide the decision of choosing the training conditions for a cost-efficient system calibration as well as an important step toward the understanding of the degradation level of the sensory system when the environmental conditions change.},

The detection was achieved by applying two potentials, –450 and –290 mV vs. a saturated mercury–mercurous sulfate electrode (MSE), at which ethanol and acetaldehyde react at different rates. Under the conditions investigated, acetaldehyde oxidation was mass transport limited at both potentials, whereas the anodic current due to the oxidation of ethanol was 40\% lower at the more cathodic potential. Detection limits of 2 and 1 ppb (S/N = 3) were determined for ethanol and acetaldehyde respectively when the analyte species were detected individually. Poisoning of the working electrode was not observed for concentrations of ethanol in the ppb range.

Sensors for carbon dioxide are required in diverse fields, from air quality control to intelligent food-packaging. The requirements for those sensors in terms of performance, detection range and price vary greatly, depending on the field under consideration. Although infrared technology detectors are very widespread and are accurate, they are still expensive for some applications; thus, a considerable research effort is focusing on the improvement of the characteristics of solid-state devices. This chapter reviews electrochemical, impedimetric (conductometric) and field-effect devices for carbon dioxide detection. Throughout the chapter, the role of semiconductor materials in different devices is analyzed.},

	abstract = {Metal oxide type (MOx) sensors are one of several technologies being employed in low-cost air quality monitors. Their size and cost make them ideally suited for portable and remote monitoring applications. Quantifying the sensor response, however, remains a significant challenge due to sensitivity to ambient temperature and humidity, and interference with non-target pollutant species. Temporal characteristics such as signal hysteresis and sensor drift over time also affect MOx sensor response.

We present a quantification model rooted in principles of semiconductor science and chemistry, yet informed by and simplified using empirical observations. This model predicts concentration from resistance while providing a correction for temperature effects, usually the most significant confounder in ambient air quality monitoring with MOx sensors, and drift due to change in the sensor heating element. The model parameter values are first determined using lab calibrations, then refined using a field collocation with reference instruments. The work thus provides both a quantification model and a means to effectively calibrate sensors for practical applications.},

	abstract = {Mobile monitoring is increasingly used as an additional tool to acquire air quality data at a high spatial resolution. However, given the high temporal variability of urban air quality, a limited number of mobile measurements may only represent a snapshot and not be representative. In this study, the impact of this temporal variability on the representativeness is investigated and a methodology to map urban air quality using mobile monitoring is developed and evaluated.

A large set of black carbon (BC) measurements was collected in Antwerp, Belgium, using a bicycle equipped with a portable BC monitor (micro-aethalometer). The campaign consisted of 256 and 96 runs along two fixed routes (2 and 5 km long). Large gradients over short distances and differences up to a factor of 10 in mean BC concentrations aggregated at a resolution of 20 m are observed. Mapping at such a high resolution is possible, but a lot of repeated measurements are required. After computing a trimmed mean and applying background normalisation, depending on the location 24 to 94 repeated measurement runs (median of 41) are required to map the BC concentrations at a 50 m resolution with an uncertainty of 25 \%. When relaxing the uncertainty to 50 \%, these numbers reduce to 5 to 11 (median of 8) runs. We conclude that mobile monitoring is a suitable approach for mapping the urban air quality at a high spatial resolution, and can provide insight into the spatial variability that would not be possible with stationary monitors. A careful set-up is needed with a sufficient number of repetitions in relation to the desired reliability and spatial resolution. Specific data processing methods such as background normalisation and event detection have to be applied.},

We introduce a rendezvous connection graph and explore the trade-off between locality of a process and the amount of time needed for the graph to be connected. Rendezvous graph connectivity has many potential use cases, such as sensor fault detection.

It includes the characterization of different sensing membranes, a discussion of the results obtained and possibilities for the future. The solid sensor membrane for gaseous CO2 based on changes in the luminiscence of a luminophore immobilized on O2-insensitive film, concurrent with the displacement of a pH indicator, has some drawbacks, such as the loss of efficiency over time and the need to maintain the sensor in special atmospheric conditions. As a solution to these drawbacks, two alternatives were tested, the first alternative was replacing the newly proposed tetraoctyl ammonium hydroxide (TOAOH ) phase transfer agent with other basic agents that did not undergo a Hoffman degradation reaction, and the second alternative was the use of hydrophilic polymers that could retain water needed for CO2 sensing more efficiently. The different membranes tested indicated that the use of tetramethyl ammonium (TMAOH) instead of TOAOH as the phase transfer agent produced better results regarding stability and sensitivity. In addition, replacing the membrane polymer with hydrophilic polymers improved the sensing characteristics in terms of response time and stability over hydrophobic polymers. With a detection limit of 0.006\%, the response time is 19 s and the recovery time is 100 s. The lifetime of the sensing membranes, which do not need to be held in any special atmosphere other than darkness, is longer than at least 300 days for membranes with TMAOH in hydrophilic polymer and 515 days for membranes with TMAOH in ethyl cellulose.},

	abstract = {Wireless sensor networks are becoming increasingly important as an alternative solution for environment monitoring because they can reduce cost and complexity. Also, they can improve reliability and data availability in places where traditional monitoring methods are difficult to site. In this study, a carbon monoxide wireless sensor network (CO-WSN) was developed to measure carbon monoxide concentrations at a major traffic intersection near the University of Cincinnati main campus. The system has been deployed over two weeks during Fall 2010, and Summer 2011-2012, traffic data was also recorded by using a manual traffic counter and a video camcorder to characterize vehicles at the intersection 24 h, particularly, during the morning and evening peak hour periods. According to the field test results, the 1 hr-average CO concentrations were found to range from 0.1-1.0 ppm which is lower than the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) 35 ppm on a one-hour averaging period. During rush hour periods, the traffic volume at the intersection varied from 2,067 to 3,076 vehicles per hour with 97\% being passenger vehicles. Furthermore, the traffic volume based on a 1-h average showed good correlation (R2 = 0.87) with the 1-h average CO-WSN concentrations for morning and evening peak time periods whereas CO-WSN results provided a moderate correlation (R2 = 0.42) with 24 hours traffic volume due to fluctuated changes of meteorological conditions. It is concluded that the performance and the reliability of wireless ambient air monitoring networks can be used as an alternative method for real time air monitoring. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Ever growing populations in cities are associated with a major increase in road vehicles and air pollution. The overall high levels of urban air pollution have been shown to be of a significant risk to city dwellers. However, the impacts of very high but temporally and spatially restricted pollution, and thus exposure, are still poorly understood. Conventional approaches to air quality monitoring are based on networks of static and sparse measurement stations. However, these are prohibitively expensive to capture tempo-spatial heterogeneity and identify pollution hotspots, which is required for the development of robust real-time strategies for exposure control. Current progress in developing low-cost micro-scale sensing technology is radically changing the conventional approach to allow real-time information in a capillary form. But the question remains whether there is value in the less accurate data they generate. This article illustrates the drivers behind current rises in the use of low-cost sensors for air pollution management in cities, while addressing the major challenges for their effective implementation.},

	abstract = {The occurrence of illnesses related with poor ventilation has driven an increasing attention towards indoor air quality monitoring. In buildings equipped with climate control systems, the diseases related to the air quality can be significantly reduced if smart intervening procedures, aiming to control the concentration of pollutants in the indoor air, can be implemented in the heating, ventilation air conditioning unit. When reliable information about both the indoor and outdoor air quality is made available, the climate control system can provide the most appropriate amount of ventilation, ensuring safe and comfortable living conditions.

In this paper, a dedicated, miniaturized, low-cost electronic nose based on state-of-the-art metal oxide sensors and signal processing techniques was developed. The proposed device is targeted to the quantification of carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide in mixtures with relative humidity and volatile organic compounds by using an optimized gas sensor array and highly effective pattern recognition techniques. The electronic nose was tested in an environment reproducing real operating conditions. Exploiting the unique response patterns of the different sensors in the array and the capability of a simple fuzzy-logic system it was possible to identify and discriminate concentrations as low as 20 ppb for NO2 and 5 ppm for CO in the test gas environment, allowing to reach the necessary sensitivity towards the target pollutants together with the selectivity towards the typical interfering gas species.},

We evaluated an Aeroqual Ltd. Series 500 semiconducting metal oxide O3 and an electrochemical NO2 sensor against UK national network reference analysers for more than 2 months at an urban background site in central Edinburgh. Hourly-average Aeroqual O3 sensor observations were highly correlated (R2 = 0.91) and of similar magnitude to observations from the UV-absorption reference O3 analyser. The Aeroqual NO2 sensor observations correlated poorly with the reference chemiluminescence NO2 analyser (R2 = 0.02), but the deviations between Aeroqual and reference analyser values ([NO2]Aeroq − [NO2]ref) were highly significantly correlated with concurrent Aeroqual O3 sensor observations [O3]Aeroq. This permitted effective linear calibration of the [NO2]Aeroq data, evaluated using ‘hold out’ subsets of the data (R2 ≥ 0.85). These field observations under temperate environmental conditions suggest that the Aeroqual Series 500 NO2 and O3 monitors have good potential to be useful ambient air monitoring instruments in urban environments provided that the O3 and NO2 gas sensors are calibrated against reference analysers and deployed in parallel.},

	abstract = {In any data assimilation framework, the background error covariance statistics play the critical role of filtering the observed information and determining the quality of the analysis. For atmospheric CO2 data assimilation, however, the background errors cannot be prescribed via traditional forecast or ensemble-based techniques as these fail to account for the uncertainties in the carbon emissions and uptake, or for the errors associated with the CO2 transport model. We propose an approach where the differences between two modeled CO2 concentration fields, based on different but plausible CO2 flux distributions and atmospheric transport models, are used as a proxy for the statistics of the background errors. The resulting error statistics: (1) vary regionally and seasonally to better capture the uncertainty in the background CO2 field, and (2) have a positive impact on the analysis estimates by allowing observations to adjust predictions over large areas. A state-of-the-art four-dimensional variational (4D-VAR) system developed at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is used to illustrate the impact of the proposed approach for characterizing background error statistics on atmospheric CO 2 concentration estimates. Observations from the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite "IBUKI" (GOSAT) are assimilated into the ECMWF 4D-VAR system along with meteorological variables, using both the new error statistics and those based on a traditional forecast-based technique. Evaluation of the four-dimensional CO2 fields against independent CO 2 observations confirms that the performance of the data assimilation system improves substantially in the summer, when significant variability and uncertainty in the fluxes are present.

	abstract = {The current WMO CO2 Mole Fraction Scale consists of a set of 15 CO2-in-air primary standard calibration gases ranging in CO2 mole fraction from 250 to 520 μmol mol−1. Since the WMO CO2 Expert Group transferred responsibility for maintaining the WMO Scale from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) to the Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL) in 1995, the 15 WMO primary standards have been calibrated, first at SIO and then at regular intervals, between 1 and 2 years, by the CMDL manometric system. The uncertainty of the 15 primary standards was estimated to be 0.069 μmol mol−1 (one-sigma) in the absolute sense. Manometric calibrations results indicate that there is no evidence of overall drift of the Primaries from 1996 to 2004. In order to lengthen the useful life of the Primary standards, CMDL has always transferred the scale via NDIR analyzers to the secondary standards. The uncertainties arising from the analyzer random error and the propagation error due to the uncertainty of the reference gas mole fraction are discussed. Precision of NDIR transfer calibrations was about 0.014 μmol mol−1 from 1979 to present. Propagation of the uncertainty was calculated theoretically. In the case of interpolation the propagation error was estimated to be between 0.06 and 0.07 μmol mol−1 when the Primaries were used as the reference gases via NDIR transfer calibrations. The CMDL secondary standard calibrations are transferred via NDIR analyzers to the working standards, which are used routinely for measuring atmospheric CO2 mole fraction in the WMO Global Atmosphere Watch monitoring program. The uncertainty of the working standards was estimated to be 0.071 μmol mol−1 in the one-sigma absolute scale. Consistency among the working standards is determined by the random errors of downward transfer calibrations at each level and is about 0.02 μmol mol−1. For comparison with an independent absolute scale, the five gravimetric standards from the National Institute for the Environmental Studies (NIES) in Tsukuba, Japan, ranging in CO2 mole fraction from 350 to 390 μmol mol−1 have been calibrated relative to the CMDL secondary standards. The average and standard deviation of the differences between the NIES gravimetric and CMDL analyzed CO2 mole fraction are 0.004 ± 0.03 μmol mol−1.},

	abstract = {The two types of electrochemical sensors using stabilized zirconia and the oxide sensing electrode (SE) were developed for NOx detection at high temperatures. For the mixed-potential-type sensor, NiCr2O4 was found to give fairly excellent NOx sensing characteristics in air among several spinel-type oxides tested. This NOx sensor provided a linear correlation between EMF and the logarithm of NO or NO2 concentration in the range 25â€“436 ppm and in the temperature range 550â€“650Â°C. With fixed bias voltage being applied between the SE (oxide) and the counter (Pt) electrode (CE), the EMF between SE and the reference (Pt) electrode (RE) was measured as a sensing signal. The NiCr2O4-attached tubular device was found to provide selective response to NO over NO2 if SE was polarized at +175 mV versus RE. It was also found that this device gave selective response to NO2 over NO, if SE was polarized at âˆ’250 mV versus CE. The new design of the planar device was proposed to avoid the cross-sensitivities to the others gases usually coexisting in car exhausts.},

	abstract = {This article concerns a pseudo-Schottky diode Palladium/Indium-Phosphide (Pdâ€“InP) gas sensor. The catalytic activity of such a palladium layer coupled with a pseudo-Schottky structure enables the measurement of very low concentrations of two highly oxidant gases: nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3). The submission of the sensor to long O3 exposures leads to a degradation of its sensor characteristics (response time, recovery time and sensitivity) due to oxidation of the palladium metallization by O3. Therefore, to improve sensor lifetime and reduce drift, a methodology based on cyclic regeneration of the sensor's palladium surface (carbon monoxide (CO) reduction associated with thermal treatment) has been developed. The pseudo-Schottky gas sensor associated with this methodology exhibits reproducible responses, significant resolution and real time detection in the range of 20â€“100Â ppb for NO2 and O3. Moreover, a sensor exposed to 20Â ppb of O3 presented twice the response of the same sensor exposed to 100Â ppb of NO2 (10.5Â nA for 6.5Â nA). Selectivity towards O3, with this methodology, is demonstrated in the case of atmospheric pollution monitoring.},

However, it is well-known that significant problems, such as cross selectivity and lack of long term stability, still affect their performance. Several studies point out that the modulation of the sensor temperature may improve the sensor performance, and different thermal modulation methods are currently available. In this work a temperature modulation scheme that needs no a priori information about the sample under test is presented. According to this method the sensor temperature value is set, through the sensor resistance value, via an Astable Multi-vibrator Circuit (AMC). The resulting output signal forms a cyclic pattern of pulses. Pulses shape depends on the sensor resistance while the pulse length depends on the measured gas. The method is here illustrated through a three-class classification instance.},

For Ag electrodes, diffusion of silver ions into the carbonate bulk causes a slow response and blocking at both high CO2 and O2 partial pressures. The response of Au electrodes becomes slower at low O2 partial pressures due to a rate-determining reaction step.

	abstract = {Estimating personal exposure to air pollution is a crucial component in identifying high-risk populations and situations. It will enable policy makers to determine efficient control strategies. Cycling is again becoming a favorite mode of transport both in developing and in developed countries due to increasing traffic congestion and environmental concerns. In Europe, it is also seen as a healthy sports activity. However, due to high levels of hazardous pollutants in the present day road microenvironment the cyclist might be at a higher health risk due to higher breathing rate and proximity to the vehicular exhaust.
In this paper we present estimates of the exposure of a cyclist to particles of various size fractions including ultrafine particles (UFP) in the town of Mol (Flanders, Belgium). The results indicate relatively higher UFP concentration exposure during morning office hours and moderate UFP levels during afternoon. The major sources of UFP and PM10 were identified, which are vehicular emission and construction activities, respectively. We also present a dust mapping technique which can be a useful tool for town planners and local policy makers.},

Furthermore, the resulted solid-electrolyte was used as the basic material for the fabrication of a planar-type CO2. The measurements showed that the output electromotive force (EMF) followed Nernst equation well in CO2 volume concentration ranging from 0.01\% to 0.1\% and its response and recovery time was less than 15 and 28\&\#xa0;s, respectively.

The array consists of quartz crystal microbalances (QCMs), each coated with a different polymeric material. The first approach uses a decision tree classification algorithm to determine the minimum number of features that are required to classify the training data correctly. The second approach employs the hill-climb search algorithm to search the feature space for the optimal minimum feature set that maximizes the performance of a neural network classifier. We also examined the value of simple statistical procedures that could be integrated into the search algorithm in order to reduce computation time. The strengths and limitations of each approach are discussed.},

The sensing ability is greatly interfered with by lithium sulfate formation on the detecting electrode surface.

The instrument employs feature extraction techniques including integral and primary derivative, which lead to higher classification performance as compared to the classical features (ΔR and ΔR/R0). It was shown that doping of carbon nanotube (CNT) improves the sensitivity of hybrid gas sensors, while quantity of CNT has a direct effect on the selectivity to volatile organic compounds, i.e., methanol (MeOH) and ethanol (EtOH). The real-world applications of this E-nose were also demonstrated. Based on the proposed methods, this instrument can monitor and classify 1 vol\% of MeOH contamination in whiskeys.},

	abstract = {Long-term stability is one of the major issues in the ongoing development of solid electrolyte based, screen-printed potentiometric CO2 sensors. Though improvements of the sensor have been reported by several research groups, mostly due to changes in material combinations, little is referred to the influence of basic technological aspects in relation to the observable degradation effects. In view of this aspect potentiometric thick-film CO2 sensors based on the electrochemical cell: Au, O2, CO2 {\textbar}Ma2CO3â€“MeCO3 (Au){\textbar}{\textbar}Na-Î²/Î²â€²â€²â€“Al2O3{\textbar}{\textbar}Na2Si2O5 SiO2 (Au){\textbar}O2, (CO2), Au \{Ma\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;Na or Li; Me\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;Ba or Ca\} were investigated regarding the long-term stability at improved operating conditions. As previous works at the IKTS in Dresden have shown that the microstructure of the Na-beta-Aluminate (NBA) and the sensor preheating conditions have considerable influence on the stability, now different carbonate materials where evaluated regarding the influence on stability at improved operating conditions. So far, satisfying performance over more than 2000\&\#xa0;h was demonstrated independent of the carbonate material used in the miniaturized CO2 sensor.},

The results obtained from the measurement of noise in these devices serve to illustrate the distinction between sensor output drift due to changes in environmental parameters and that exclusively due to 1/f noise. An attempt is made to quantify the measured noise by describing its effect on sensor resolution. Attempts by the authors to compensate for the presence of 1/f noise through the use of sensor array signal processing are described, including the use of multi-channel signal averaging. This approach is based on the premise that although multiple-time averaging and auto-correlation methods can be used as a means of removing noise from repetitive signals these methods cannot be applied in the case of non-periodic signals. Both of the sensor applications described here involve the measurement of low frequency components in the wanted signal which also precludes the use of standard filtering techniques for the removal of noise.},

NaNO2 and NaNO3 were formed in the NO2-containing air, while NaOx (presumably Na2O2) was formed in the NO2-free air. It is concluded that NaOx is formed through the cathodic reaction of O2, while NaNO2 is formed as a primary product of the cathodic reaction of NO2. It is also concluded that NaNO3 is formed as a secondary product of the chemical reaction between NaOx and NaNO2 in dry condition, although the reaction between NaOx and gaseous NO2 also takes place in the humid condition as another root for NaNO3 formation.},

The proposed system exploits a state-of-the-art evolutionary strategy to iteratively tweak the coefficients of a linear transformation able to transparently transform raw measures in order to mitigate the negative effects of the drift. The system operates continuously. The optimal correction strategy is learnt without a-priori models or other hypothesis on the behavior of physical-chemical sensors.

As active sensor material, a p-type organic semiconductor, αα-ωω-hexyl-distyrylbithiophene (DH-DS2T), was used. DH-DS2T based transistors exhibit high mobility together with a good air stability. As a chemical compound, DH- DS2T presents a good solubility in common organic solvent, which means thin films could also processed by solution fabrication. Sensor responses were studied by measuring the current through the semiconductor organic film as an ammonia gas concentration function (NH3: 25, 50, and 100\&\#xa0;ppm). We demonstrate here that DH-DS2T has efficient sensor responses and leads to an efficient fully solution processed gas sensor on flexible substrate.},

Sensors have been prepared by suspending a 130 m2 gâˆ’1 Î±-Fe2O3 powder in a standard Nb solution in order to yield Nb/Fe atomic percentages between 0.5 and 20 at.\%. Sintering has been performed at 800 Â°C for 2 h. XRD patterns show corundum-type Î±-Fe2O3 occurrence and FeNbO4 phases when the Nb doping is greater than 10 at.\%. The 20\% doped material shows a gas sensitivity (S), defined as RG/RA, where RA and RG are the electrical resistances in air and in the sample gas, respectively, as high as 36 at 100 ppm NO2 and 200 Â°C working temperature. No sensitivity to NO has been measured at 100 ppm NO by utilizing N2 as a carrier gas. The NOx sensitivity has been discussed in terms of the actual NO and NO2 gas concentrations measured by an electrolytic gas sensor at the exit of the sample chamber. The conversion of NO to yield NO2 has been experimentally measured to be 6\% if a residence time of 60 s and an O2 concentration higher than 2 vol.\% are chosen. The NO2 response is unaffected by the presence of NO gas. An electrical equivalent circuit including a constant phase element (CPE), which can simulate the electrical response of the sensor in the 0â€“100 ppm NO2 gas concentration range, is also presented.},

	abstract = {The peculiarities in the sensor response to ozone are discussed for SnO2 thin films. Films with thickness from 30 to 200 nm were deposited by spray pyrolysis. The study of sensor response kinetics and humidity influence on the gas sensing characteristics was used to understand these unique responses. The response to dry (ozone + air) gas of the films was a multiple-step process, reflecting a complex reaction mechanism. The presence of humidity in the surrounding atmosphere made this process still more complicated. It was found that adsorption/desorption of both water and oxygen controlled the kinetics of gas response of the SnO2-based sensors. Interestingly, higher pyrolysis and operation temperatures both promoted a lowering of the humidity influence on the gas sensor response.
This work suggests that the appearance of a slower component in sensor response at higher temperatures, Toper {\textgreater} 400 °C, is connected with the increased influence by diffusion processes in the bulk of the SnO2 grains, which is consistent with reduction/reoxidation processes.},

It was concluded that water and oxygen adsorption/desorption processes are the main factors controlling the rate of response and recovery of the In2O3 gas sensors. Only during response to ozone in dry air the time of intergrain or bulk oxygen diffusion determines the sensor response time.

	abstract = {1. While teaching statistics to ecologists, the lead authors of this paper have noticed common statistical problems. If a random sample of their work (including scientific papers) produced before doing these courses were selected, half would probably contain violations of the underlying assumptions of the statistical techniques employed. 2. Some violations have little impact on the results or ecological conclusions; yet others increase type I or type II errors, potentially resulting in wrong ecological conclusions. Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and policy decisions are often at stake. 3. Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4. Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations. It is therefore essential for good quality management and policy based on statistical analyses.},

The sensors utilize non-intrusive optical sensing techniques to measure atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations with unprecedented vertical and horizontal resolution ({\textasciitilde}1 m) within the planetary boundary layer. The sensors are developed to measure greenhouse gas species including carbon dioxide, water vapor and methane in the atmosphere. Key innovations are the coupling of very low power vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) to low power drive electronics and sensitive multi-harmonic wavelength modulation spectroscopic techniques. The overall mass of each sensor is between 1–2 kg including batteries and each one consumes less than 2 W of electrical power. In the initial field testing, the sensors flew successfully onboard a T-Rex Align 700E robotic helicopter and showed a precision of 1\% or less for all three trace gas species. The sensors are battery operated and capable of fully automated operation for long periods of time in diverse sensing environments. Laser-based trace gas sensors for UAVs allow for high spatial mapping of local greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmospheric boundary layer where land/atmosphere fluxes occur. The high-precision sensors, coupled to the ease-of-deployment and cost effectiveness of UAVs, provide unprecedented measurement capabilities that are not possible with existing satellite-based and suborbital aircraft platforms.},

	abstract = {Objective To determine if a low-cost particle counter, the Dylos DC 1700, can be used in homes to quantify second-hand smoke (SHS) concentrations.
Methods Participants were recruited from a hospital-based study of attitudes on smoking. Two photometric devices (Dylos DC1700 and Sidepak AM510 Personal Aerosol Monitor) capable of measuring and logging concentrations of particulate matter were placed in smoking and non-smoking homes for approximately 24h. Acquired data were randomly allocated to one of two groups: one was used to generate a calibration equation using regression techniques; the second was used for validation of the generated model. The mean difference and limits of agreement between the two instruments were calculated using the validation dataset. Summary air-quality results were also compared across the entire dataset.
Results Over 500 001 minute concentration measurements were collected from 34 homes. 25 301 randomly selected paired-measurements were used to generate a calibration equation (R2 0.86) converting the particle number concentration from the Dylos to a mass concentration of PM2.5 as measured by the Sidepak. The mean difference (limits of agreement) between the remaining 25 102 paired measurements was −0.09 (−49.7 to 49.5) with 3.2\% of values outside the limits of agreement. Differences in the air quality information generated by the two instruments were generally small and unlikely to impact on user interpretation.
Conclusions The Dylos appears to be a valid instrument for measuring PM2.5 in household settings. The Dylos may be useful in air quality-based interventions designed to change smokers’ behaviours with the possibility of encouraging cessation and/or smoke-free homes.},

	abstract = {Benzene is an air pollutant especially harmful for human health, because of its carcinogenic and mutagenic  properties.  Although  it  has  low  acute  toxicity  the  repeated  exposure  to  high concentrations can cause the effects on the blood and blood forming organs. The most convincing evidences  are  found  for  the  development  of  leukaemia  as  a  result  of  benzene  exposure.  This compound commonly occurs in the air of urban areas and comes mainly from combustion of liquid fuels  in  car  engines  and  (in  Poland)  hard  coal  in  domestic  furnaces.  There  are  also  industrial sources of benzene emission, such as refineries, cokeries and power plants. Monitoring of benzene and its alkyl derivatives (BTX) is obligatory in urban areas, according to the Directive 2000/69/EC. 
The paper presents results of the field experiment with the use of  ETL2000 (multi-component air quality monitor; UniTec - Ferrara, Italy) for benzene monitoring. The ETL2000 is the system based on  a  new  solid-state  thick-film  sensor  technology,  which  provides  appropriate  selectivity  and accuracy  for  measuring  airborne  pollutants,  occurring  in  ppb  concentrations.  Thick-film  sensors technology exploits electric conduction phenomena that happen above the layer of nanostructured 
semiconducting  metal  oxides  at  the  fixed  temperature  (200-400 o C).  An  electrical  response  from semiconductor is proportional to particular gas concentration. The signal is turned into given gas concentration using a suitable fitting calibration curve. Benzene sensor is the newest device in the ETL  system  and  there  aren’t  enough  operating  data.  Benzene  concentrations  were  recorded continuously as 15-min averages from 5 th  April to 25 th  May 2006 in Zabrze, at the air monitoring station  of  the  Silesian  Regional  Inspectorate  of  Environmental  Protection  (SRIEP).  At  the  same time  the  measurements  of  15-min  benzene  concentrations  were  performed  using  the  reference analyzer AirmoBTX1000 (gas chromatograph with the flame ionization detector). The comparative analysis  of  obtained  results  was  performed,  with  the  use  of  nonlinear  regression  techniques,  to determine the range of application of ETL2000 with benzene sensor in the urban conditions.  
It was stated that the application of the ETL2000 with benzene sensor in urban conditions is limited to the places directly vulnerable to the emission of this pollutant – in the neighborhood of the busy traffic  routes  or  industrial  installations.  The  sensor  is  presenting  properly  the  changes  of  higher concentrations, including the peaks of concentrations. The decrease of sensitivity and selectivity of the  concentrations  up  to  3 µg/m 3   was  observed,  which  is  manifested  with  the  overstated participation of very low concentrations. The underestimated average annual concentration reduced the sensor usability to monitor benzene in urban and sub-urban background stations.},

	abstract = {Abstract
Studies in environmental exposure science have developed a preference for smaller devices that can be easily co-located without need for gas standards, such as those instruments utilized in the Near-road Exposures and Effects from Urban Air Pollutants Study (NEXUS). One observation from NEXUS was the potential for instrument interference from alcohol-based particle counters on photometric-based nitrogen oxide (NOx) monitors. This article reports the findings from laboratory tests replicating enclosed-shelter monitoring configurations and operation cycles for a common photometric-based NOx monitor and a widely used alcohol-based particle counter. These tests monitored the NOx response while the particle counter sampling interval and ambient airflow rate were varied to (1) confirm that proximity between the instruments induced interferences, (2) identify any dependencies in NOx monitor recovery on ambient airflow, and (3) determine the time needed for the NOx monitor to recover to pre-interference levels under different atmospheric conditions. During particle counter operations, NOx concentrations responded instantaneously with a several-fold jump above the measurement baseline. When the particle counter was operated for more than 10 min, this interference period also showed a marked decline in the NOx baseline. The overall recovery time of the NOx monitor depended less on the time of particle counter operation, and more on the speed of ambient airflow. If photometric-based NOx monitors need to be operated alongside alcohol-based particle counters, mechanisms must be employed to exhaust alcohol-based vapors from enclosed monitoring environments. Given the strong evidence for interference, however, it is recommended these devices not be operated within close proximity to one another.},

	url = {http://trip.cc.tut.fi/dpub/handle/123456789/6830},
	abstract = {In computer world, plug-and-play is a commonplace. In general, the sensor manufacturers use various standard physical interfaces in their sensors but they are not compatible in measurement data transfer. IEEE 1451 and ISA-100 standardization is working on common interfaces for industrial applications. The lack of standards in the field of sensor manufacturer require each sensor to be integrated individually to a wireless sensor node. 
This thesis presents the design of a sensor integration process for Tampere University of Technology Wireless Sensor Network (TUTWSN). The integration process eases the sensor integration, shortens the required time to integrate a sensor, and minimizes the frequency of errors and the presence of software bugs. The included documentation minimizes the loss of information in multi-partner projects. The integration process consists of five major phases: selecting a sensor, hardware integration testing, integration to a node, integration to a server infrastructure, and testing phases. The focus of this thesis is in the node and its embedded software. 
The integration process is tested with five sensors which are integrated to TUTWSN. The sensors are: multipurpose standard industrial signal sensor, air velocity sensor, power meter sensor, radon sensor, and piezoelectric motion detector. Two of the sensors are using I2C interface, two are using analog-to-digital converter, and one is using interrupts. 
Multipurpose standard industrial signal sensor required designing and calibrating the whole sensor and new software components on each level. Air velocity sensor needed a fitter sensor board for an existing transmitter and a new software application. Power meter sensor required designed and calibrating the sensor and a new software application. Piezoelectric motion detector required a new sensor and modification to motion detection application. Calibration is in all the cases done with an existing sensor and the designed sensor are calibrated according to it. The sensor integration takes less than two weeks time on average from selecting the sensor to adopted wireless sensor network. /Kir10},

	abstract = {Solid electrolyte based sensors are well-suited for use at high-temperatures and are thus promising candidates for measuring gas compositions in combustion environments. Oxygen partial pressures can be directly measured by a galvanic cell with an oxygen ion conducting electrolyte, but sensors for carbon monoxide and other reducing gases require more complicated mechanisms. These mechanisms rely on changes in the voltage, current or impedance associated with the oxidation of the reducing gas on the electrolyte surface, all of which depend on the kinetics of the electrode reactions. The electrode kinetics, and thus the magnitude and selectivity of the sensor response, depend on the electrolyte and electrode materials. In this paper, the materials used in solid electrolyte based sensors for the measurement of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon gases are reviewed. Emphasis is placed on potentiometric mixed-potential sensors, but amperometric and impedancemetric sensors are also discussed.},

The solid electrolyte couple consisted of 2-mm-thick sintered disk of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 and a thin film of (8 mol\% Y2O3) ZrO2 approximately 6 Î¼m thick. YSZ thin film on Nasicon disk was prepared by multiple radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering technique. The sensor employs Na2SO4 as an auxiliary or sensing electrode that is in contact with Nasicon. The SO2 present in the gas mixture is converted to SO3 by passing over heated Pt-catalyst. The sensor has been successfully tested in the laboratory environment. At a fixed concentration of 1000 ppm SO2, the electromotive force (emf) of the sensor was found to vary nonlinearly as a function of temperature between 823 and 1123 K. However, at a fixed temperature of 973 and 1023 K, the measured emf of the sensor was found to vary linearly as a function of the logarithm of concentration of SOX in the gas mixture between 100 and 3000 ppm. In the current sensor design, both electrodes are exposed to the same test gas eliminating the need for isolating the electrode compartments.},

The problem treated involves classifying whether a sensed signal is generated by one of four chemicals. Two broad approaches to processing the sensor signals are discussed, one based on classical signal processing approaches, and one based on a model of how the olfactory system in animals functions. The classical approaches used include: Gram Schmidt orthogonalization, fast Fourier transforms, and Haar wavelets. For the experimental signals treated, the classical approaches give superior results compared to those produced by the olfactory model.},

However, if the thickness is decreased further to submicrometer scale (i.e. âˆ¼0.5\&\#xa0;Î¼m), the sensor showed much lower sensitivity and sluggish response to CO. The possible reason could be related to the decrease of the effective area of the triple phase boundary and higher charge carrier transport resistance due to the much thinner porous ITO film.},

It was found that the sensitivity of the sensor with ScSZ and ITO as the electrolyte and sensing electrode, respectively, decreased although the magnitude of the sensor signal was found to increase as the concentration of tin in the ITO composite increased. The sensor using the spherical ITO particles as the sensing electrode exhibited higher sensitivity than that of the sensor employing the ITO powders with coexisting rod-like and spherical morphologies. The sensitivity of the sensor based on YSZ electrolyte did not show much difference from that of the ScSZ-based sensor. However, the sensor utilizing the perovskite-type oxygen ion conductor (LSGM) displayed much lower sensitivity and much slower response to the test gas than those based on stabilized zirconia.},

The current response of the NaNO2-attached device was almost linear with the NO2 concentration in the range of 0â€“80 ppm. In addition, it was demonstrated that the sensitivities of the device to various other gases, such as NO, CO, H2, CO2, CH4 and H2O, were very small compared to that to NO2 and the device could be operated rather stably during the test period of ca. 40 days except for a few days in the early stage.

The aim is to find the original source signal (wavelet) and signature of the medium (reflectivity sequence) from the available sensor measurements. Our model assumes that the data are generated as a convolution of an unknown wavelet with various time-scaled versions of an unknown reflectivity sequence. This type of data occurs in many array signal processing applications, including radar, sonar and seismic processing. Our approach relies on exploiting the redundancy in the measurements due to time-scaling which is introduced by the geometry and the sensor placement, and does not require knowledge of the wavelet or reflectivity sequence. Furthermore, we make no assumptions on the statistical properties of these signals. We formulate and solve the deconvolution problem as a quadratic minimization subject to a quadratic constraint. We also illustrate the performance of the technique using simulation examples.},

The formulae expression tree for the fusion of feature parameters has been discussed and then the selection, crossover and mutation for the genetic algorithm were studied in depth.

For NO2 reduction at the Pt/NafionÂ® cathode fixed in the range of 0.8â€“0.82\&\#xa0;V, transfer coefficient (Î±), standard apparent rate constant (rk0) and the exchange current density calculated were 0.32, 9.72\&\#xa0;Ã—\&\#xa0;10âˆ’4\&\#xa0;m/s and 19.22\&\#xa0;Î¼A/cm2, respectively.

Results show that all the parameters studied have an important effect on sensor response, especially when a highly reactive gas is being measured. Both electrode placement and film thickness must be considered if sensor sensitivity and selectivity are to be increased.

In order to choose the proper polymers, seven potential polymers were chosen from numerous available polymers according to the principle of the linear solvation energy relationship (LSER). Different possible sensors arrays (128 arrays) composed of these seven polymers were designed by full factorial design (FFD). Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that four of seven polymers had enough ability to recognize different gas classes. By using Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), the tested polymers were categorized into four main groups with respect to their recognition ability. Combination of the FFD with PCA and HCA, brought to the identification of 8 proper arrays containing four polymers in each array. Precisely evaluation of predicted arrays with respect to their calculated resolution factors showed that the electronic nose containing the polymers of 75\% pheny125\% methylpolysiloxane (OV25), hexafluoro-2-propanolsubstituted polysiloxane (SXFA), poly bis(cyanopropyl)-siloxane (SXCN) and poly(ethylene maleate) (PEM) was the most proper design for recognition of analytes of interest.

	abstract = {The ability to select definite and unique selectivity profile from a variety of molecular organic materials predetermines their using as sensitive layers for cross-selective sensor massifs. However, to gain greater insight into how the instrumental performance depends on various parameters of such sensitive layers there is a need for a flexible, yet cost effective methodology for the estimation of the natural recourses of organic materials to monitor complex gas mixtures. In the present work the use of the cluster analysis method in the â€˜fuzzy logicâ€™ concept for the optimization of the cross-selective sensor arrays (â€˜electronic noseâ€™, EN) is considered. This approach enables to purposefully form the sensor elements arrays with definite chemical functionality optimized for the solution of the specific applied problems. The criteria of the optimization of the sensor response, number and type of the sensor elements are considered with the goal of the improvement of the classification of the pharmaceutical products of the wide use.

On the base of analysis of the response kinetic peculiarities the physical mechanisms were considered, which determines the peculiarities of the adsorptionâ€“desorption processes at the interface. It was shown that adsorption of molecules from complex mixtures decays nonexponentially in general: in a â€œweakâ€ adsorbers films it is exponential and approaches a stretched exponential for â€œstrongâ€ adsorbers film. Moreover the stretched exponentiality in adsorptionâ€“desorption processes can be described in terms of probabilistic model of relaxation based on the self-similarity of distributed random transition rates. We have demonstrated the first application of the stretched exponential low for nonexponential relaxations of QCM sensors with organic sensitive layers. There is a good agreement between molecular structure of materials, interfacial dynamics of sensors and discrimination ability of massifs thereon.},

The response time (t0.99) of the cell varies between 1.9 ks at 750 K and 0.06 ks at 1100 K. The e.m.f. response is faster when the partial pressure of SOx at the electrode is increased than when it is decreased.},

We present here some of our consolidated results on the optimization of chemical gas sensors based on metal oxide semiconductors. In order to increase sensitivity and selectivity while keeping fabrication at low cost, three major research directions have been considered: (1) the use of semiconductor nanoparticles in the fabrication of screen-printed gas sensors to increase the sensitivity; (2) the printing of sensitive layers on alumina tiles using a simple mechanical layer-by-layer technique to further increase the sensitivity; (3) the control and tailoring of surface chemistry of nanoparticles proved to be a critical step for further device optimisation. To date, our sensor prototypes are capable of detecting O3 and NOx concentrations down to 20 and 50\&\#xa0;ppb, respectively, and CO concentrations down to 3\&\#xa0;ppm in air. These prototype devices can be used as sensing elements in novel and cost-effective air monitoring microstations.},

We demonstrated in this study that metal oxide gas sensors may have highly improved performances for both accuracy and run time, when used in optimum conditions. The different noise components were quantified referring to popular words (equivalent of ethanol concentration) using the transfer function of the sensor. It was pointed out that sample surrounding greatly affects the noise level, and that the signal-to-noise ratio may be dramatically increased, reducing the distortion generally assessed between sensor and system detection limits. The standard deviation (std) for 100 ppm of ethanol in water was \&lt;4 ppm, the quantification noise \&lt;1 ppm; and the short-term sensor drift \&lt;2.5 ppm.

It was also shown that the cycle time may be reduced to less than 10 min, keeping the high accuracy over a large concentration range (10 to 10,000 ppm). The sample throughput could not be improved more because of the headspace equilibration, which cannot be reduced. These performances are truly similar to those measured by using Mass Spectra systems.},

These selective sensor responses can be obtained in the ranges of gas concentrations close to or below threshold limit values while the working temperature of sensors can be kept below 300 Â°C.

Polycrystalline Bi2O3 doped devices exhibit a reverse sensitivity to NOx both in air and in nitrogen at temperatures of 300 Â°C or less. In this case sensor resistance falls markedly upon exposure to the oxidising gas. In contrast sensors prepared from undoped SnO2 which had been precalcined at 1500 Â°C behave in a conventional manner, where marked resistance increases are observed in the presence of NOx. Gas sensitive thin films fabricated via the oxidation of a metallic Sn layer display high sensitivity to NOx while remaining unresponsive to common interfering gases such as carbon monoxide or methane.},

The model captures two functions in the early olfactory pathway: chemotopic convergence of sensory neurons onto the olfactory bulb, and center onâ€“off surround lateral interactions. Sensor features are first topologically projected onto a two-dimensional lattice according to their selectivity profile, leading to odor-specific spatial patterning. The resulting patterns serve as inputs to a network of mitral cells with center onâ€“off surround lateral inhibition, which enhances the initial contrast among odors and decouples odor identity from intensity. The model is validated using experimental data from an array of temperature-modulated metal-oxide sensors. Our results indicate that the model is able to improve the separability between odor patterns that is available at the inputs.},

Silver and palladium were the main constituents used as dopants in stannic oxide thin films which were made by the RF cathode sputtering technique on alumina substrates (3 Ã— 3 mm2) consisting of screen-printed heating resistors and gold electrodes. The sensors doped with silver were very sensitive to H2S, while the palladium-doped sensors were very sensitive to hydrogen, for instance, but not at all sensitive to H2S. The sensor array system was installed at a city air pollution monitoring station where the H2S and SO2 concentrations were being simultaneously recorded by commercial analyzing equipment based on coulometric titration together with the signals from the semiconductor gas sensor array. Together with the H2S concentration peaks from the commercial equipment, resistance of the silver-doped sensors decreased drastically. In some cases, a relatively high response of the palladium-doped sensors (insensitive to H2S) together with the response of the silver-doped sensors proved that H2S emission was accompanied also with the emission of other gases. In some cases, the response of the palladium-doped sensors was present without any response of the silver-doped sensors.},

The graphene films are transferred to different substrates after wet etching of the copper substrates. The Raman spectra reveal that the graphene films made on SiO2/Si substrates are of high quality. The reflectance spectra of graphene were measured in UV/Visible region of the spectrum. Theoretically calculated reflectance spectra based on Fresnel's approach indicates that the CVD graphene has a single layer. The gas sensing properties of graphene were tested for different reducing gasses as a function of measurement temperature and gas concentration. It is found that the gas sensing characteristics such as response time, recovery time, and sensitivity depend on the target gas, gas concentration, test temperature, and the ambient gas composition. The cross sensitivity of few combinations of reducing gasses such as, NH3, CH4, and H2 was also investigated.},

This paper presents a new strategy to extract features from the response of a thermally modulated semiconductor sensor for gas identification. This strategy contains two main steps. First, make the sensor work under temperature modulation and pre-process the sensor's response signal. The presented pre-processing method can suppress the influence of environmental temperature or humidity on sensor response. Secondly, apply wavelet decomposition to extract features of the pre-processed sensor's response curves. The rules of selecting the resulted wavelet coefficients as the characteristic variables for gas identification are also presented. Experiments results show that the strategy proposed here allows accurate discrimination between gases studied (hydrogen, carbon monoxide and their binary mixture) over a wide concentration range, from 10 to 1000\&\#xa0;ppm, by using only one commercial metal oxide gas sensor and owns good ability of restraining the influence of gas concentration variation, sensor's cross sensitivity and sensor drift on the identification result. Experiments also show that the proposed strategy outperforms FFT for the featured extraction from the response of thermally modulated semiconductor gas sensor.},

In the first step, a multilevel pseudo random sequence (ML-PRS), which allows for modulating the operating temperature of the sensors in a wide frequency range, is used to obtain an estimate of the impulse response of each microsensor-gas system. ML-PRS are interesting because they help to reduce the effects of noise and non-linearity as experienced with gas sensors. In the second step, by analysing the spectral components of the impulse response estimates, the modulating frequencies that better help in discriminating and quantifying the gases and gas mixtures considered are found. Finally, by selecting a subset of the best modulating frequencies, an optimised multi-frequency temperature-modulating signal can be synthesised. The method is illustrated by analysing different concentrations of NH3, NO2 and their mixtures using a microarray of WO3-based gas sensors, but it can be further applied to any given gas analysis problem.},

This paper introduces a new strategy combing wavelet decomposition and a distributed support vector machine network to identify gas mixtures. In a previous study concerning identifying gases of a few types, we had demonstrated that wavelet decomposition outperforms FFT in feature extraction from responses of thermally modulated semiconductor gas sensors. Here, we extend this method of recognizing gas mixtures of a large type and generalize the rules of selecting the character variables from decomposed wavelet coefficients as character variables. Besides, a distributed support vector machine network is introduced to discriminate the character variables into gas patterns instead of traditional BP neural network. Experiment results show that the strategy proposed here can perform accurate discrimination between hydrogen (H2), carbon monoxide (CO), ethane (C2H4) and their mixtures (total seven patterns) over a range of 50â€“1000\&\#xa0;ppm, by using only one commercial metal oxide semiconductor gas sensor, and the discrimination result has advantages in restraining gas concentration variation, sensor's drift and environmental changes. Experimental result also suggests that a distributed support vector machine outperforms a single support vector machine and a BP neural network in performing gas mixture identification.},

	abstract = {Wurtzitic ZnO is a wide-bandgap (3.437 eV at 2 K) semiconductor which has many applications, such as piezoelectric transducers, varistors, phosphors, and transparent conducting films. Most of these applications require only polycrystalline material; however, recent successes in producing large-area single crystals have opened up the possibility of producing blue and UV light emitters, and high-temperature, high-power transistors. The main advantages of ZnO as a light emitter are its large exciton binding energy (60 meV), and the existence of well-developed bulk and epitaxial growth processes; for electronic applications, its attractiveness lies in having high breakdown strength and high saturation velocity. Optical UV lasing, at both low and high temperatures, has already been demonstrated, although efficient electrical lasing must await the further development of good, p-type material. ZnO is also much more resistant to radiation damage than are other common semiconductor materials, such as Si, GaAs, CdS, and even GaN; thus, it should be useful for space applications.},

Chemical doping with NO2 molecules changed the conductivity of the graphene layers, which was quantified by monitoring the currentâ€“voltage characteristics at various NO2 gas concentrations. The adsorption rate was found to be more rapid than the desorption rate, which can be attributed to the reaction occurred on the surface of the graphene layer. The sensitivity was 9\% when an ambient of 100\&\#xa0;ppm NO2 was used. Graphene-based gas sensors showed fast response, good reversibility, selectivity and high sensitivity.

The gas action makes the conductance of the device, measured parallel to the surface between ohmic contacts, decrease. It is shown how the thickness and the doping level of these layers affect the sensor sensitivity. A simple model is proposed to describe the gas action, based on ionization of chemisorbed NO2 molecules inducing field-effect mechanism. Calculations lead to thickness, doping level and gas concentration dependence in agreement with experimental results. The ability for environmental applications is also discussed and it is concluded that even if such devices can detect low NO2 concentrations, they suffer from limitations due to a parasitic effect of moisture.},

At the same time it retains knowledge of previously learned patterns or pattern categories. This adaptation ability helps the network to solve many of the problems encountered with tin oxide gas sensors, like instabilities and degradation. The functionality of the network is presented in the two cases of one and four input providing gas sensors.

	abstract = {The concept of producing one gas sensor on one microhotplate is extended towards a gas sensor array consisting of several sensors on one hotplate. Twelve miniaturised gas sensors of nanoparticulate tin oxide were integrated as an array on a single microhotplate by using soft lithography, i.e. micromolding in capillaries. Soft lithography is a microfabrication technique based on elastomeric molds of poly-dimethylsiloxane (PDMS) for pattern transfer. It is ideally suited to directly micro-shape liquid materials, including suspensions of oxidic powders. PDMS molds containing recessed microchannels could be placed directlyâ€”and removed after processingâ€”on freestanding silicon nitride membranes of 250\&\#xa0;nm thickness without causing damage. Tin oxide microlines were generated after applying a suspension droplet at the entrance of the microchannels and filling them by capillary force action. A single sensor was shrunk on a minimal area of 10\&\#xa0;Î¼mÃ—30\&\#xa0;Î¼m. In gas sensitivity experiments with carbon monoxide concentrations from 100 to 2000\&\#xa0;ppm, a maximal sensitivity to carbon monoxide of 600\&\#xa0;ppm was obtained. The heating power required to operate the whole array is reduced by at least one order of magnituede compared to the power that is usually required to run an array of multiple (\&gt;10) micromachined gas sensors.},

	abstract = {Quantitative analysis of gases, by means of semiconductor sensor arrays and pattern-recognition techniques such as artificial neural networks, has been the goal of a great deal of work over the last few years. However, the lack of selectivity, repeatability and drifts of the sensors, have limited the applications of these systems to qualitative or semi-quantitative gas analysis. While the steady-state response of the sensors is usually the signal to be processed in such analysis systems, our method consists of processing both, transient and steady-state information. The sensor transient behaviour is characterised through the measure of its conductance rise time (Tr), when there is a step change in the gas concentration. Tr is characteristic of each gas/sensor pair, concentration-independent and shows higher repeatability than the steady state measurements. An array of four thick-film tin oxide gas sensors and pattern-recognition techniques are used to discriminate and quantify among ethanol, toluene and o-xylene [concentration range: 25, 50 and 100 ppm]. A principal component analysis is carried out to show qualitatively that selectivity improves when the sensor behaviour is dynamically characterised. The steady-state and transient conductance of the array components are processed with artificial neural networks. In a first stage, a feed-forward back-propagation-trained ANN discriminates among the studied compounds. Afterwards, three separate ANN (one for each vapour) are used to quantify the previously identified compound. Processing data from the dynamic characterisation of the sensor array, considerably improves its identification performance, rising the discrimination success rate from a 66\% when only steady-state signals are used up to 100\%.},

In particular, if the sensors are submitted to real life conditions, their response becomes ambiguous because of ambient water vapour. There are several techniques to cope with this problem. A first method to decrease the influence of the relative humidity is to incorporate additives into the tin oxide. However, with this method it is impossible to eliminate the influence of water to an acceptable level. Another method is to use an array of sensors and to convert the response of this array by means of mathematical algorithms, in order to obtain a response that is insensitive to water vapour. The method presented in this paper consists of switching a single tin oxide gas sensor between two well-defined temperatures. With this method, it is possible to decrease the sensitivity to water vapour to an acceptable level, while the high sensitivity to CO is unaffected.},

Cross-sensitivities to the major inorganic gaseous species found in the atmosphere, are also presented, and the use of a chemical filter to circumvent the interference by nitrogen dioxide is described.},

	abstract = {A model has been developed for the sensing mechanism of metal oxide-based thick-film gas sensors. The model explains the behaviour of the sensor conductance as a function of the concentration of test gas and the operating temperature of the sensor. Using the Schottky-barrier conduction mechanism through grain boundaries, a relationship between the degree of surface coverage Î¸ and the conductance G has been obtained. To relate the conductance with the concentration of the gas, the Freundlich adsorption isotherm for gases and vapours on a solid surface has been used. The isotherm relates the degree of surface coverage Î¸ with the partial pressure of the gas (concentration). By eliminating Î¸, an expression relating the variation of G with concentration has been obtained. To study the validity of the model, a thick-film Pd-doped tin oxide gas sensor has been fabricated and tested with propanol (C3H7OH). The variation in the conductance with changes in concentration and temperature has been observed. The observed data show an excellent fit with the developed model. Using the experimental data, the constants of the theoretical equation have also been evaluated.},

	abstract = {One of the modern problems in the physical chemistry of the Earth's atmosphere is that of the stratospheric ozone, its variation and the possibilities of its destruction. The processes leading to ozone-layer exhaustion are essentially at altitudes up to 100 kn. Their description and forecasting are not possible without precise measurement of the concentrations of ozone and some other small components of the atmosphere that affect the ozone regime. Such measurements are also necessary for the investigation of the atmospheric effects of stratospheric supersonic aviation flights. The existing measurement methods (electrochemical or chemoluminescent types of ozone sensors, resonant fluorescent spectroscopic analysers) are not always adequate for contemporary requirements. In this communication the possibilities of using chemical sensors based on semiconductor metal oxides are considered. These sensors offer the opportunity of measurement of both the ozone and a series of other small components of the ozonosphere (OH, Cl, Cl2, 1O2, and others). The experimental peculiarities of obtaining and detecting some of the above-mentioned particles and the possibilities of selectively distinguishing the useful signal are discussed. Semiconductor chemical sensors, because of their characteristics high sensitivity (104â€“106 cmâˆ’3), fast-action (\&lt; 1s) and simplicity of signal transformation, are very promising for use on flying devices such as spaceships, rockets and balloons. As an example, a flying atomic oxygen analyser has been developed and successfully used for atmospheric investigations.},

The main objective is to measure in real time with a high level of accuracy the variations of oxidizing gases concentration in bus passenger compartments to inform travelers or commuters and to evaluate the assessment of bus driversâ€™ exposure. A self-contained gas sensor microsystem of which the sensitive element is constituted by a thin layer of copper phthalocyanine has been developed, validated at laboratory under controlled experimental conditions and then implemented in a bus of the urban network of Clermont-Ferrand, France. Preliminary in-car measurements realized with commercial analyzers show that nitrogen dioxide is the major oxidizing gas present on urban roads and so is considered as the target gas in this study. Tests realized under artificially polluted atmosphere show the high performances obtained with our microsystem, such as high resolution, low threshold, good reproducibility, satisfying concentration range and real time detection. The calibration curve has been determined at laboratory by experiments made under low NO2 concentrations in the range of those measured in urban atmosphere. The relation between sensor microsystem response and gas concentration is established with accuracy. The validation of our microsystem is illustrated by measurements realized under real conditions, i.e., in an urban bus. It shows that NO2 concentration variations are mainly correlated with the nature of roads and that rates of pollutant measured in traffic are always greater than those measured by the nearest stations of the air quality control network.},

It is also shown that the features of the input to the transducer are important to determine in which situation the proposed method is needed. The harmonic and random cases are analysed, showing that different calibration strategies are required in the two different situations. The calibration of a hysteretic transducer is therefore much more complex than that of a non-hysteretic one. The analysis is carried out numerically, adopting a model to simulate the behaviour of hysteretic load cells and then a real case is analysed at the end of the paper.},

	abstract = {In the study, a MEMS-based benzene gas sensor is presented, consisting of a quartz substrate, a thin-film WO3 sensing layer, an integrated Pt micro-heater, and Pt interdigitated electrodes (IDEs). When benzene is present in the atmosphere, oxidation occurs on the heated WO3 sensing layer. This causes a change in the electrical conductivity of the WO3 film, and hence changes the resistance between the IDEs. The benzene concentration is then computed from the change in the measured resistance. A specific orientation of the WO3 layer is obtained by optimizing the sputtering process parameters. It is found that the sensitivity of the gas sensor is optimized at a working temperature of 300 °C. At the optimal working temperature, the experimental results show that the sensor has a high degree of sensitivity (1.0 KΩ ppm−1), a low detection limit (0.2 ppm) and a rapid response time (35 s).},

Sensor technologies with capability of continuous real time monitoring of ammonia concentration in air are needed to qualify ammonia emissions from agricultural activities and further evaluate human and animal health effects, study ammonia environmental chemistry, and provide baseline data for air quality standard. We have developed fiber optic ammonia sensors using different sensing reagents and different polymers for immobilizing sensing reagents. The reversible fiber optic sensors have detection limits down to low ppbv levels. The response time of these sensors ranges from seconds to tens minutes depending on transducer design. In this paper, we report our results in the development and evaluation of fiber optic sensor technologies for air quality monitoring. The effect of change of temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide concentration on fiber optic ammonia sensors has been investigated. Carbon dioxide in air was found not interfere the fiber optic sensors for monitoring NH3. However, the change of humidity can cause interferences to some fiber optic NH3 sensors depending on the sensor's transducer design. The sensitivity of fiber optic NH3 sensors was found depends on temperature. Methods and techniques for eliminating these interferences have been proposed.},

The powders for the thick-film pastes were made by heating various mixtures of SnO and WO3 powders, corresponding to the nominal formula SnxWO3+x with x between 0.5 and 1.72, in an argon atmosphere at 600Â°C for 15 h. The Î±-SnWO4 phase was the result of heating of an equimolar mixture of SnO and WO3 powders. Tin appears in the valence state Sn2+ in Î±-SnWO4, but in the SnxWO3+x mixed oxides the MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopy revealed both Sn2+ and Sn4+ valence states of tin. In addition to the MÃ¶ssbauer experiments, X-ray diffraction (and Raman spectroscopy) were used to study the structure of the mixed oxides used in the thick films. The electrical conductivity together with the gas-response properties of the films were studied at different temperatures between room temperature and 500Â°C. H2S, H2, CO, SO2, NO and NO2 at various concentrations in synthetic air were used as test gases in the measurements. Some thick films were very sensitive and selective to H2S and had an anomalous response to NO.},

In this study, we demonstrate that a device combining NASICON with an oxygen-ion conductor of BiCuVOx (Bi2Cu0.1V0.9O5.35) can electrochemically detect volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as ethanol, formaldehyde, and toluene. The sensing electrode made of BiCuVOx was attached onto a sintered NASICON disk at high temperature to produce an interfacial layer that had a different morphology and composition from those of NASICON and BiCuVOx, as observed by scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis. The device in which NASICON was fitted with the BiCuVOx-based electrode was found to efficiently detect VOCs in ppm concentrations. The sensor signal (electromotive force) exceeded 100\&\#xa0;mV in response to 10\&\#xa0;ppm HCOH at 400\&\#xa0;Â°C, demonstrating the high sensitivity of the device. It also exhibited a relatively quick response, reproducible and stable sensor signals, and high selectivity to VOCs. The sensor responses followed behavior typical for mixed-potential-type gas sensors based on oxygen-ion conductors. It was thus suggested that the electrochemical oxidation of VOCs with oxide ions took place at the interfacial oxygen ion-conductive layer that was formed by the reaction of NASICON with BiCuVOx.},

The response times of one sensor to upward concentration changes of the investigated combustibles increase in the same order and at a similar ratio as the sensitivities to these combustibles. Investigations show that the electrode morphology and layout have a deep impact on the response time of these sensors. Nevertheless, these parameters can be optimized in a way that enables the construction of sensors with response times t10â€“90\&\#xa0;\&lt;\&\#xa0;100\&\#xa0;ms by using nano-powders for the MeO additive.

A new data selection method for renewing the standard of the emf is investigated in order to monitor CO2 concentration using Î”emf. The output of the CO2 monitor corresponds to a conventional non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) analyzer.},

The response time which is defined as the time to attain a 90\% response is less than several minutes. The sensor output variation with the CO2 concentration shows a clear 1 to 1 relation and obeys the theoretical Nernst relation.

Catalytic activity of such palladium layer permits to measure very low concentrations of two powerful oxidizing gases, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3), constituting main urban atmospheric pollution. After many O3 submissions, degradation of gas sensor characteristics (response time, recovery time and sensitivity) appears, probably due to ozone oxidation of palladium metallization. Different treatments (H2 reduction, CO reduction and high vacuum) were then tested to avoid degradation of sensor parameters. Initial response and recovery times of this sensor can be recovered by H2 reduction and high vacuum treatment of metallization layer after exposure to ozone. Moreover, results emphasize that these treatments improve sensor sensitivity. CO reduction will permit to have reproducible measurements of low NO2 and O3 concentrations.},

The goal of this research is to develop a gas sensor that can monitor the total VOC (TVOC) gases indoors and then to control the ventilator efficiently using the sensor. In order to develop a sensor that detects TVOC, the responses of four oxide semiconductor materials to 37 different VOC gases were studied. These materials showed small responses to halogenated and aliphatic hydrocarbon gases. As a result of improving the response to these gases, among four metal oxides examined, SnO2 and WO3 showed high sensitivities by the addition of Pd and Pt. The sensing properties of SnO2 for halogenated hydrocarbon gases were greatly improved by the addition of 0.5 wt\% Pd. The sensing properties of SnO2 for aliphatic hydrocarbon gases were improved by the addition of 0.7 wt\% Pt. In addition, a sensor element with the addition of both platinum and palladium, that is, Pt (0.5 wt\%)-Pd (0.5 wt\%)-SnO2, showed a large response to many of the VOC gases examined. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A process where 2 min exposure alternates with 8 min static rest period leads, after a conditioning period, to a stable and reproducible signal. The response of the device (55 pA ppb-1 min-1) is linearly correlated to the ozone concentration in air, in the range 0-150 ppb.

	url = {http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2hr314qs},
	abstract = {Identification of aircraft cabin environmental quality concerns for which sensors may be useful  
•  The highest priority environmental indicators identified are ozone and cabin air pressure, followed by carbon 
monoxide and carbon dioxide with moderate priority, and then relative humidity, airborne particles, and organic 
contaminants, including engine oil byproducts and pesticides. This list is based on the Congressional 
requirements and recent scientific literature, starting with information from recent studies (NAS/NRC, 
ASHRAE/Battelle), and continuing by seeking input from a variety of stakeholders.  
•  The parameters that can be monitored routinely with off-the-shelf sensor technology are ozone, cabin pressure, 
CO, CO2 and relative humidity. These formed the prioritized list of environmental parameters for in-flight 
sensing.  
Definition of requirements for sensor and sensor systems  
LBNL investigators deduced that sensors intended to provide data for routine use by stakeholders must 
emphasize simplicity, ruggedness and satisfactory performance with limited attention by the crew and 
maintenance staff.  In order to guide maintenance of environmental control systems and document exposure to 
contaminants, sensors should be installed at multiple locations in the bleed air and cabin air 
supply/recirculation system, including the return duct. Packaging requirements for installation and operation 
on aircraft emphasize simplicity, ruggedness and satisfactory performance with limited attention by the crew 
and maintenance staff. Within these limits:  
•  Specific requirements or benchmarks for performance emphasize accuracy (±15\%), sensitivity (low 
ambient levels), and sampling interval (≤60 s).  
•  Suggested requirements include limitations on the size of sensor elements (≤ 3/8 in diameter), weight of 
sensor systems (≤1 kg), power (28 V), frequency of maintenance (coincident with service schedules), required 
operator skill (minimal) and target cost for replaceable sensor elements (≤ \$100).
Sensor systems most capable of meeting current requirements.  
A survey of sensor systems, parameter by parameter, from highest priority to lowest, is included as Appendix A. 
Systems chosen for testing were based on principles that are representative of the main approaches that are utilized 
currently for real-time monitoring of the prioritized  parameters. The use of COTS systems simplified the 
experimental approach because data  from their sensors could be acquired  without project staff designing and 
building prototype units. However, no COTS system met all the specifications or benchmarks.  To proceed under 
this limitation, sensors judged to be most capable of meeting requirements were tested in COTS systems based on 
IR or UV spectroscopy, electrochemical cells, and metal oxide semiconductors.  The selected technologies were 
based on light absorption (UV for ozone and non-dispersive IR for carbon dioxide) and electrochemistry 
(electrochemical cells and metal oxide semiconductors for ozone and carbon monoxide). Pressure sensors are 
already standard in aircraft, although the output needs to be logged. 
Performance of sensors 
Representative sensor technologies were tested in the laboratory under conditions that occur in-flight (cabin air 
pressure 0.7 to 1 atm; temperature from 65 to 85 °F) and at ground level (relative humidity from 20 to 80\%). The 
results show that neither the EC nor MOS-based sensors responded with at least ±15\% accuracy, primarily due to 
poor reproducibility and hysteresis. The sensors based on light absorption (UV for ozone and IR for CO2) 
performed better under the influence of changes in pressure, temperature and humidity than the sensors that 
depend on electrochemistry (for ozone and CO, analyte-induced redox reactions at sensing and counting electrodes 
(EC) or at the gas sensing surface of the (HMOS sensor)).  The UV-based sensor gave unacceptable performance 
({\textgreater} 15\% change) only when the relative humidity exceeded 65\%, but this condition does not occur in flight because 
RH rarely exceeds 30\%.  The optical sensors, both UV and NDIR, need further miniaturization before they can be 
installed routinely in aircraft. 
Recommendations for sensor development   
•  Circulate the main findings of this study among sensor manufacturers to stimulate development of improved 
technologies.  
•  Implement ASHRAE’s recommendations for routine monitoring to encourage aircraft-specific sensor designs. 
When large markets exist for monitoring aircraft cabin environmental quality (ACEQ), developers and 
manufacturers will have more incentive to miniaturize optical sensors and tailor materials for EC, MOS and 
other to meet the performance specifications. Costs could approach the benchmark of  ≤ \$100 per sensor 
element. (Current EC and MOS sensor elements cost at least twice the target amount.) 
Recommendations for future sensor testing 
•  Broaden the usefulness of the results by evaluating the performance of a larger selection of existing sensors, 
including GOTS and sensors in the research phase.  This would provide stronger guidance for both sensor 
development and industry-wide monitoring of ACEQ. 
•  Evaluate the performance of improved sensor materials and assess the performance of systems that become 
candidates for widespread use in aircraft. A body such as an ASHRAE committee of stakeholders and sensor 
developers could use LBNL’s protocol as a starting point for evaluating improved sensors. 
•  Use LBNL’s protocols to screen sensor systems before more rigorous testing intended to overcome the 
limitations of this study.  
•  Test sensor systems for cross-sensitivity to ozone, CO, then add VOC (toluene, terpenes) ethanol and halogen-
containing species (pesticides and flame retardants). 
•  Evaluate using CO/CO2 ratios to signal incidents caused by pyrolysis products. 
•  Collaborate with aircraft engineers for in-flight testing of the best available sensor technologies.},

In addition, the need to use multi-element arrays is much reduced since a single sensor can be interrogated at a wide range of frequencies. This gives rise to much increased information content for the measurements. This paper describes the use of alternating current (a.c.) interrogated conducting organic polymers coupled with neural network pattern recognition techniques for a system to determine the compositional fraction of volatile vapour mixtures.

	abstract = {Sensing mechanisms of gas sensors depend on temperature, and this is in particular true for metal-oxide semiconductors where the peculiar role of temperature suggested the modulation of temperature as a viable method to tune selectivity and sensitivity. This principle was widely investigated in the past, and methods to design ad-hoc temperature behaviors have been proposed. In this paper, instead of a-priori temperature profiles, a self-adaptive temperature modulation is proposed. For the scope, a closed-loop circuit connecting the sensor resistance to the sensor heater is designed. In this condition changes in sensor resistance are reflected into changes of operating temperature. Herewith, the method is implemented with an oscillatory circuit, so with a steady resistance value the signal driving the temperature modulation converges to a periodic pattern of pulses that is specific for the sensor state. Since the relationship between resistance and temperature may depend on the quality and the quantity of the gas at which the sensor is exposed, the temperature modulation signal is likely dependent on the kind of gas and its concentration. As a consequence, features describing the temperature modulation signal pattern can be used as a multicomponent variable that can allow for gas identification and quantification. The hypothesis is confirmed by simulations with electronics CAD software and experiments with a commercial metal-oxide semiconductor gas sensor. Results show that optimal gas identification and concentration are simultaneously possible with a unique sensor device.},

The properties of the mass transfers and the reaction characteristics of the gas-sensitive porous system are analyzed. The effects of pore size distribution and porosity on the concentration field of detected gas and the effective utilization degree of the porous matrix are provided. The results indicate that the Thiele number, which can reflect the relative magnitude of chemical reaction rate and gas diffusion velocity in nature, is the main basis for judging the effects of various parameters. It usefully reproduces the observed effects of pore structure and reaction temperature on diffusion and chemical reaction response, showing that the gas sensitivity and the effective utilization coefficient of the gas sensitive porous medium can be controlled by adjusting key parameters. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.},

The eight types of sensors (including pure tungsten oxide ones) were tested in the presence of ammonia, hydrogen sulphide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and methane. It was found that gold improved the sensitivity to H2S. On the other hand, doping with Ag and Pt led to higher responses to NO2 and NH3, respectively. No response to CH4 was observed. The sensitivity to CO was very low. The influence of the working temperature on the sensor response was also studied.

The developed system allowed rapid replacement of the gas atmosphere in the chamber where a gas sensor device was placed within 0.3\&\#xa0;s. It was revealed that the response speed of the sensor device based on a SnO2 porous film (pore size at maximum population: 37\&\#xa0;nm) was remarkably fast, reaching a response time of less than 1\&\#xa0;s for H2 and CO detection at 250 and 350\&\#xa0;Â°C. This suggests that the diffusion and surface reaction of H2 and CO are quite fast in the porous film. On the other hand, the recovery speed was not comparably fast and the resistance of the device did not recover to the original state within 20\&\#xa0;s after switching the gas atmosphere in the chamber from the sample gases to air. This is possibly due to the slow desorption of the H2O and CO2 that were formed by the surface reaction of H2 and CO, respectively with the adsorbed oxygen on SnO2.},

The electromotive force (EMF) output from the sensors linearly changed with logarithm of VOC concentration, and sufficiently large output was confirmed at sub-ppm levels. Among the examined VOCs, ethanol exhibited the highest sensitivity (âˆ’54.1\&\#xa0;mV/decade) at 400\&\#xa0;Â°C. However, the sensitivity of ethanol drastically decreased at 500\&\#xa0;Â°C. Thus the sensitivity of all the VOCs examined in this study was tunable with temperature. An increase in temperature decreased the sensitivity but effectively modified the response and recovery times.

Combustion gases such as NOx, SO2 and benzene were detected in a highly toxic atmosphere formed by N2, O2, H2S, HF, HCl and water vapour. Sensitivities by 100\% were obtained for different sensors when exposed to NOx and SO2. Six volatile organic compounds coming from contaminated soils were successfully identified using different pattern recognition methods such as principal component analysis and backpropagation neural networks. In both cases the use of the normalized fractional conductance change as preprocessing algorithm was decisive. Quantitative determinations of the mixtures of the volatile compounds were performed with relative prediction errors ranging from 2 to 50\% for the calibration set. Higher errors were found using the validation data set. Backpropagation neural networks with partially connected hidden layer resulted in general more satisfactory than multiple linear regression methods because the response models were not well satisfied for all the sensors.

	abstract = {We report on a trial to construct an intelligent gas sensing system based on the information embedded in a non-linear dynamic response, an application that has possibilities for various kinds of practical usage. By applying a sinusoidal voltage to a heater attached to SnO2, a characteristic time-dependent trace of the sensor resistance is obtained as a response to environmental gases. In order to evaluate the characteristic response in a quantitative manner, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is performed for the dynamic response. Higher harmonics, obtained by performing the FFT, were processed using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). It is shown that with these procedures one can simultaneously distinguish and quantify individual gas components. Actually, we show that eight different gases (methanol, ethanol, acetone, diethyl ether, benzene, iso-butane, ammonia and ethylene) as well as natural air can be identified with a single sensor, and can also be quantified with an accuracy of less than 30\%. It has been confirmed that our system exhibits long-term reproducibility, and the ability for discrimination and quantification.},

The CdCr2O4-attached device gave a linear correlation between EMF and the logarithm of NO or NO2 concentration at 500â€“600Â°C. The mixed potential sensing mechanism was also verified. In order to improve the sensitivity and selectivity to NO, the above device was modified to three-electrode structure. With a fixed bias voltage being applied between the sensing (oxide) and counter (Pt) electrodes, the voltage between the sensing and reference (Pt) electrodes was measured as a sensing signal. The responses to NO and NO2 were found to be enhanced and suppressed with a positive bias, respectively. The tubular device with two-electrode structure was tested for amperometric detection of NOx. A CdCr2O4-attached tubular device was found to show quick and selective response to NO over NO2 at 500 and 550Â°C, if the oxide sensing electrode was polarized at +100 mV versus the reference Pt electrode. The NOx sensing mechanisms of the three-electrode device were proposed and discussed on the basis of the sensing characteristics obtained.},

When very low concentrations are to be measured, e.g. less than 2\&\#xa0;ppb for environmental monitoring and 50\&\#xa0;ppb for diagnostic breath analysis, solid-state ammonia sensors are not sensitive enough. In addition, they lack the required selectivity to other gasses that are often available in much higher concentrations. Optical methods that make use of lasers are often expensive and large. Indirect measurement principles have been described in literature that seems very suited as ammonia sensing devices. Such systems are suited for miniaturization and integration to make them suitable for measuring in the small gas volumes that are normally available in medical applications like diagnostic breath analysis equipment.},

	abstract = {Thick-film gas sensors were fabricated by screen-printing technology starting from different nanostructured semiconducting oxide powders both n-type and p-type; ultrafine and homogeneously sized ceramic powders were prepared using chemical methods such as sol-gel techniques and thermal decomposition of heteronuclear complexes. The temporal evolution of the conductivity changes in the various semiconducting oxide thick films were studied in comparison with the concentrations of CO, NO, NO2 and O3 in the atmosphere as measured by the analytical equipment. An air quality control experiment in an urban area through some arrays of nanostructured thick-film sensors without an in situ calibration is described. Through the calibration performed directly in the field, one of the monitoring units by means of the conventional equipment, it was possible to evaluate the pollutants' concentration in various points of the city. The good results obtained with this experiment allow us to consider the feasible use of the innovative station to measure the pollution due to the automotive traffic. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

It is shown that the gas sensing properties observed for the WO3 films deposited with three interruptions are highly enhanced to oxidizing gases in comparison with those sensing films prepared without interruptions. For instance, the response of the fabricated micro-sensors to nitrogen dioxide and ozone is up to four times higher than that of the micro-sensors prepared using the basic technology.},

	abstract = {In this paper, organic thin films based on two types of metal-macromolecules, i.e., zinc-2,9,16,23-tetra-tert-butyl-29H,31H-phthalocyanine (ZnTTBPc) and zinc-5,10,15,20-tetra-phenyl-21H,23H-porphyrin (ZnTPP), were demonstrated to discriminate among diverse volatile organic compounds (VOCs) even if they have very similar functional group. The ZnTTBPc and the ZnTPP thin films have been prepared by spin coating technique and then were tested for their optical response to VOCs, which share a similar carbonyl (C = O) group, namely acetone, formaldehyde (in a mixture form with methanol) and acetic acid, based on UV-Vis absorption. The transduction employs the optical response of selected spectral ranges arranged in an array configuration, which is then subjected to the principal component analysis (PCA). The PCA results have shown successful discrimination of these VOCs. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation was employed to study the interactions between these VOCs and the sensing materials. The calculation yields different degrees of interactions for each VOC, in compliment with the experimental results. This work supports the prospects of this organic sensor for beverage industry where VOCs are abundant in their products.},

	abstract = {Tungsten trioxide (WO3) was prepared by acidification of Na2WO4 with acid solutions such as H2SO4, HCl, and HNO3 (pH 0.5 to -0.8) and tested for its NO2 sensing properties. Acidification with strong acid solutions (pH -0.5, -0.8) was found to produce lamellar-structured WO3 particles, which consisted of nano-sized crystalline plates that were 100-350 nm in lateral size and 20-50 nm in thickness, as observed by XRD and SEM analyses. The sizes of the primary and secondary particles were decreased by decreasing the pH of the acid solution used. This was accompanied by an increase in the specific surface area. The NO2 responses of the prepared WO3 lamellae were dependent on their morphology. The device using smaller WO3 lamellae prepared with a H2SO4 solution (pH -0.8) had the highest sensor response, exhibiting a high sensor response (S = 150-280), even to dilute NO2 (50-1000 ppb) in air at 200 °C. The use of smaller lamellae resulted in a decrease in the electrical resistance of the device, probably due to intimate contact between smaller lamellar particles, which allowed the detection of NO2 in a rather wide concentration range. In addition, the developed device showed high NO2 selectivity without substantial interference from NO.},

This device combines the great sensitivity and the partial selectivity toward oxidizing gases of a molecular organic semiconductor, copper phthalocyanine, with the O3 filtering selectivity of an organic material, indigo. Experimental measurements highlight filtering yield of indigo close to 100\% toward O3 and lower than 10\% for NO2. Nanometric indigo layers were realized for the first time by thermal evaporation and characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy. Such all-organic device exhibits a high NO2 sensitivity for low concentrations, a resolution better than 20 ppb, a threshold of detection to few ppb and a high level of selectivity. The influence of filtering layer thickness and the optimization for real-time measurements are also discussed. Beyond sensor development, such nanostructured indigo layers are relevant as protective element of electronic components against adverse ozone effects.},

We believe it can also be beneficial in addressing another source of limited knowledge we have to face when dealing with real world problems: concept and sensor drifts. In this paper we describe the results of two artificial olfaction investigations that show semi-supervised learning techniques capabilities to boost performance of state-of-the art classifiers and regressors. The use of semi-supervised learning approach resulted in the effective reduction of drift-induced performance degradation in long-term on-field continuous operation of chemical multisensory devices.},

Towards this end, a multiobjective control problem is formulated and control is synthesized by generating a potential field force for each objective and combining them through analysis and design. Different from standard potential field methods, the composite potential field described in this paper is time-varying and planned to account for moving obstacles and vehicle motion. Basic conditions and key properties are derived using rigorous Lyapunov analysis. Simulation examples are included to illustrate both the design process and performance of proposed control.},

Conventional air pollution monitoring station is used to provide reference data. We show how a multivariate calibration can be achieved with the use of two weeks long on-field data recording and neural regression systems. Also for these pollutants, no significant performance boost was detectable when longer recordings were used. The influence of an appropriate feature selection for achieving optimal performances is also discussed comparing long term performance results of the obtained calibrations.

The Pt/NafionÂ® electrode was prepared by the impregnationâ€“reduction (Iâ€“R) chemical plating method and was tested over the NO concentration range from 0 to 500\&\#xa0;ppm. It is assumed that the electrooxidation of NO gas at the electrode can be considered as an irreversible process, from which a transcendental equation describing the Iâ€“E relationship can be derived. The derived Iâ€“E relationship fits the experimental data reasonably well. Several electrochemical parameters for the reaction, including the half-wave potential (E1/2), the standard apparent rate constant (rak0), the transfer coefficient (Î±), and the exchange current density (i0) can be extracted from the experimental data. Under the kinetic controlled regime, with the potential in the range of 0.7â€“0.9\&\#xa0;V (versus Ag/AgCl/sat. KCl), the kinetic model predicts the electrooxidative behavior of NO at a Pt/NafionÂ® electrode over a wide concentration range of 100â€“500\&\#xa0;ppm. An amperometric NO gas sensor based on a Pt/NafionÂ® electrode has been fabricated and tested over the NO concentration range from 0 to 500\&\#xa0;ppm at 1.15\&\#xa0;V (versus Ag/AgCl/sat.

	abstract = {The efficient monitoring of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) at concentrations commonly measurable in urban atmosphere (from few ppb to 100\&\#xa0;ppb) by an original gas sensor microsystem is presented in this paper. The reproducibility, resolution, threshold and selectivity are criteria especially quantified and discussed. The sensitive element is a mere chemiresistor based on a thin layer of copper phthalocyanine (CuPc), a skilled molecular material, well known to be strongly sensitive towards oxidising species such as NO2. The implementation of a judicious methodology of measurements, founded on the exploitation of the sensor response kinetics at low temperatures, allows the NO2 monitoring to be optimised. By means of such a methodology, sensor drawbacks such as long response time and drift are avoided. As a result, the sensing performances are certainly improved. The optimum experimental parameters, namely sampling period, temperatures and exposure time/regeneration time ratio are argued and justified experimentally. Measurements under well-controlled and artificially NO2-polluted atmosphere illustrate the best performances obtained. As a consequence, the measurements are reproducible with a very low detection threshold (10\&\#xa0;ppb) and a high resolution is accomplished (\&lt;20\&\#xa0;ppb). Moreover, the concentration level is accessible in real time. Finally, the selectivity of this microsystem towards NO2 using an all-organic sensor/filter integrated device is also discussed.},

Higher-temperature operation is achieved by the use of Ba(NO3)2-based material for the auxiliary sensing electrode. The use of NaNO2 is found to give excellent sensing characteristics to both NO2 and NO, following Nernst's equation. Surprisingly the NOx responses of these sensors are totally independent of coexistent oxygen, requiring re-examination of the sensing mechanisms.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel low-cost instrument that uses a sensor based on conductivity changes of heated tungstic oxide, which is capable of accurately measuring ambient concentrations of ozone. A combination of temperature steps and air flow-rate steps is used to continually reset and re-zero the sensor. A two-stage calibration procedure is presented, in which a nonlinear transformation converts sensor resistance to a signal linear in ozone concentration, then a linear correlation is used to align the calibration with a reference instrument. The required calibration functions specific for the sensor, and control system for air flow rate and sensor temperature, are housed with the sensor in a compact, simple-to-exchange assembly. The instrument can be operated on solar power and uses cell phone technology to enable monitoring in remote locations. Data from field trials are presented here to demonstrate that both the accuracy and the stability of the instrument over periods of months are within a few parts-per-billion by volume. We show that common failure modes can be detected through measurement of signals available from the instrument. The combination of long-term stability, self-diagnosis, and simple, inexpensive repair means that the cost of operation and calibration of the instruments is significantly reduced in comparison with traditional reference instrumentation. These instruments enable the economical construction and operation of ozone monitoring networks of accuracy, time resolution and spatial density sufficient to resolve the local gradients that are characteristic of urban air pollution.},

Under typical operating conditions of the UV-LED, the radiation flux density Ï• over the sensor was of about 5\&\#xa0;Â·\&\#xa0;1017\&\#xa0;photons/cm2. Powders and films have been characterized by means of TG-DTA, SEM, TEM and XRD. Finally, electrical measurements have been performed on sensing films with the aim to compare conductive properties, surface barrier heights and ozone sensing features with and without UV irradiation. Despite the fact that two types of conventional heated sensors offered quite similar results with respect to ozone sensing, it turned out that, at RT and with the assistance of UV light, ZnO behaved excellently fast detecting ozone at concentrations down to 10 ppb, while for WS10 under the same operating conditions an opposite result was observed, i.e. very low response and long response time.},

Each ?GC prototype has a pretrap and partially selective high-volume sampler of conventional design, a micromachined-Si focuser for injection, dual micromachined-Si columns for separation, and an integrated array of four microscale chemiresistors with functionalized gold nanoparticle interface films for multichannel detection. Scrubbed ambient air is used as the carrier gas. Field-generated calibration curves were linear for injected TCE masses of 26?414 ng (4.8?77 ppb·L; r2 {\textgreater} 0.98) and the projected single-sensor detection limit was 0.052 ppb for an 8-L air sample collected and analyzed in 20 min. Consistent performance between the prototypes and good medium-term stability were shown. Above the mitigation action level (MAL) of 2.3 ppb for the field-test site, ?GC TCE determinations fell within ±25\% of those from the reference method for 21 of 26 measurements, in the presence of up to 37 documented background VOCs. Below the MAL, positive biases were consistently observed, which are attributable to background VOCs that were unresolvable chromatographically or by analysis of the sensor-array response patterns. Results demonstrate that this type of ?GC instrument could serve the need for routine TCE determinations in VI-related assessment and mitigation efforts.},

At the height of 79 m, the concentrations of PM10, PM2.5 and PM1, decrease to about 60\%, 62\% and 80\% of the maximum occurring at 2 m above the ground, respectively. However, the horizontal profiles near another major road revealed there was no significant trend of decrease in concentrations of particulate matter as the distance from the road increases. Over the total measured distance (0-228 m), the maximum decreases of PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 are only 7\%, 9\% and 10\%, of the maximum occurring at 2 m from the road, respectively. The daytime averaged PM2.5 and PM1 contribute 66-67\% and 51-60\%, respectively, of the total PM10 mass after the particle readings by DustTrak were recalibrated by TEOM. It showed that fine particles and submicrometer particles contributed a major part of PM10 at the roadside in Macao, which is most likely attributed to the combinations of local sources including exhausted particulate matter from vehicles and resuspended fine dust, and secondary particles (sulfate, nitrate and ammonium) of regional scales.},

	abstract = {Studies involving carbon monoxide (CO) exposure assessment are mainly based on measurements at outdoor fixed sites or in various indoor micro-environments. Few studies have been based on personal exposure measurements. In this paper, we report results on personal measurements of CO in five European cities and we investigate determinants which may influence this personal exposure.

Within the multi-centre European EXPOLIS study, personal exposure to CO, measured every minute for 48\&\#xa0;h, of 401 randomly selected study participants (mainly non-smokers) was monitored in Athens, Basle, Helsinki, Milan and Prague. Each participant also completed a time-microenvironment-activity diary and an extended questionnaire. In addition, for the same time period, ambient levels of CO from fixed site stations were collected.

There are significant differences in both personal exposure and ambient levels within the five cities, ranging from high values in Milan and Athens to low in Helsinki. Ambient levels are a significant correlate and determinant of CO 48-h personal exposure in all cities. From the other determinants studied (time spent in street traffic, time of exposure to ETS and time of exposure to gas burning devices) none was consistently significant for all cities. Change of the ambient CO levels from the 25th to the 75th percentile of its distribution resulted in a 1.5â€“2 fold increase of 48-h personal exposure. Short time personal exposure was also studied in order to assess the influence of specific sources. Exposure levels were significantly higher when participants were in street traffic and in indoor locations in the presence of smokers.

Personal 48-h exposure of non-smokers to CO varies among urban populations depending primarily on the ambient levels. For a CO source to be a significant determinant of the personal 48-h CO exposure, it has to affect the levels of CO in the person's proximity for an adequate length of time. Activities of individuals affect shorter term personal exposure.},

The sensor exhibits enhanced selectivity to o-xylene and p-xylene compared to six other tested volatile organic compounds as well as to humidity. The sensitivities to o-xylene and p-xylene were âˆ’0.27 and âˆ’0.19\&\#xa0;kHz/ppm of vapor concentration in air, respectively. The sensor exhibits excellent repeatability and stability over a period of at least 75 days, and relatively quick response times (on the order of a minute), but rather low recovery times (in the range of several minutes). The sensor's sensitivity increases linearly with the mass of the polymer, but it is only slightly dependent on the sensor's length.},

The complete system architecture includes a group of sensor nodes, a base station, and an internet data center. For the design of wireless sensor node, the JN5139 micro-processor is adopted as the core component and the Zigbee protocol is used for wireless communication between nodes. With an ARM7 microprocessor and embedded ZKOS operating system, a proprietary gateway node is developed to achieve data influx, screen display, system configuration and GPRS based remote data forwarding. Through a Client/Server mode the management software for remote data center achieves real-time data distribution and time-series analysis. Besides, a GSM-short-message-based interface is developed for sending real-time environmental measurements, and for alarming when a measurement is beyond some pre-defined threshold. The whole system has been tested for over one year and satisfactory results have been observed, which indicate that this system is very useful for greenhouse environment monitoring.},

A sinusoidal temperature change is applied to a semiconductor gas sensor, and the resulting conductance of the sensor is analyzed. The sensor response changes characteristically depending on the composition of the gas species and is analyzed by fast Fourier transformation (FFT). Not only the individual concentrations of samples but also the competition effect on the sensor responses to gaseous mixtures are evaluated by the higher harmonics of FFT. The physicochemical parameters on the sensor response are estimated based on information from the non-linear response under the application of temperature modulation. The competition effect on the response to two samples is discussed in relation to the kinetics of gas molecules on the semiconductor surface.},

The response of these sensors is studied for various operating temperatures and reducing gas ambients. Reducing gases used for testing the response are hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane, as they belong to three distinct chemical families. It is observed that the response of these sensors follows a power-law relationship, with the exponent value always remaining less than one at higher concentrations of reducing gas. Films deposited at 25 and 350 Â°C and heat treated at 650 Â°C in O2 ambient for 2 h are found to be more suitable for sensor application compared to films deposited at intermediate temperatures and heat treated under identical conditions. Further, the response of the sensor is found to deteriorate with a decrease in operating temperature. It is also concluded from the results that a thin-film SnO2 sensor can be used as a selective sensor for H2 at either low operating temperature or under very low background concentrations of other reducing gases. Finally, the above-mentioned results are explained using existing physical models.},

A sinusoidal temperature change was applied to a semiconductor gas sensor, and the resulting conductance of the sensor was analyzed by fast Fourier transformation (FFT). The higher harmonics of the FFT characterized the nonlinear properties of the response at the sensor surface. The amplitudes of the higher harmonics exhibited characteristic changes which depended on the kinetics of the gas species on the sensor surface, and on the range and frequency of the cyclic change in temperature. The characteristic nonlinear response of a gas sensor which depends on the range of a cyclic change in temperature is discussed in relation to the kinetics of gas molecules at the sensor surface.},

Several new fabrication and testing methods allow the detection of a number of analytes including CO (\&lt;5\&\#xa0;ppm), NOx (\&lt;1\&\#xa0;ppm), SO2 (\&lt;1\&\#xa0;ppm), and NH3 (500\&\#xa0;ppb). We outline a progression of fabrication techniques, including an HCl cleaning process, which allow the formation of much more efficient porous silicon sensors. Selectivity and enhanced sensitivity are developed using electroless metal deposition to form a gold or tin oxide nanostructured framework interacting with the nanopore-coated microporous surface. The ability to monitor sensor response in the presence of external noise sources is increased with the introduction of an FFT filtering technique. These studies present the first detection of CO with a porous silicon sensor as well as a considerable improvement in the sensitivity to NH3. It is suggested that a diffusion-based model can be used to parameterize the response of the sensors. We demonstrate several applications of these sensors to the monitoring of gas mixtures as exemplified by the NH3/NOx system. The potential for these sensors in arrayed configurations with integrated CMOS devices is considered.},

In this paper, we intend to show a review of some important mechanisms of detection in these kind of sensors. Some data about accuracy, selectivity, response time and limits of detecting species are also reported.

Finally, two methods of obtaining sensors are also reported; the first consists of a pyrolysis of organometallic compounds and the latter evaporation of metallic tin followed by a controlled oxidation process.},

	abstract = {The behaviour of gas-sensitive resistors based on WO3 towards small concentrations of ozone in air can be understood with a simple model involving the reaction of ozone with surface oxygen vacancies. This model
has been validated by comparison with experimental results for the effects of varying oxygen partial pressure on the ozone response. A complete description of the behaviour of devices constructed by printing WO3 as
porous layers onto an impermeable substrate requires consideration of the effects of the microstructure of such a device upon its response. A very simple series–parallel equivalent circuit model captures the effects and
allows a simple interpretation of the sensor behaviour, including the quadratic limiting steady state resistance response to ozone and the effects of variation of device thickness. An important fact that allows WO3 to be
used at rather high temperatures as an effective ozone sensor is that ozone does not decompose at any discernible rate on the oxide surface. Saturation of the oxide surface at ambient temperature with water vapour inhibits the ozone response when the sensor is subsequently heated. The effect can be removed by heating at sufﬁciently high temperature. Water vapour also gives a high-temperature sensor response, but appears to act at sites different to those that mediate the response to ozone.},

As sensitivity towards NO2 and O3 is very high even for gas concentrations commonly found into the atmosphere, these sensors can operate in real atmosphere conditions to monitor these two criteria pollutants.

These powders were used to produce prototype thick-film sensors. Four series of thick-film samples were fabricated by screen-printing, fired for 1 h at 650 and 850 °C. The morphology and gas-sensing properties were examined and compared with those of pure and Ta-added titania films, previously studied by the authors. Ta addition inhibited the anatase-to-rutile phase transformation during heating and was also effective in keeping the TiO2 grain size in the nanometre range. On the contrary, V addition facilitated the anatase-to-rutile phase transformation. Thick films obtained from the two powders had similar conductance behaviour vs. temperature. The gas response of the films was affected by both the grain size and firing temperature. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In the first house, with documented TCE VI, temporal variations in TCE air concentrations were monitored continuously for up to 48 h near the primary VI entry location under different levels of induced differential pressure (relative to the subslab). Concentrations ranged from 0.23 to 27 ppb by volume (1.2?150 ?g/m3), and concentration trends agreed closely with those determined from concurrent reference samples. The sensitivity and temporal resolution of the measurements were sufficiently high to detect transient fluctuations in concentration resulting from short-term changes in variables affecting the extent of VI. Spatial monitoring showed a decreasing TCE concentration gradient with increasing distance from the primary VI entry location. In the second house, with no TCE VI, spatial profiles derived from the ?GC prototype data revealed an intentionally hidden source of TCE within a closet, demonstrating the capability for locating non-VI sources. Concentrations measured in this house ranged from 0.51 to 56 ppb (2.7?300 ?g/m3), in good agreement with reference method values. This first field demonstration of ?GC technology for automated, near-real-time, selective VOC monitoring at low- or subppb levels augurs well for its use in short- and long-term on-site analysis of indoor air in support of VI assessments.},

Fibers, characterized by an average thickness of 56 ± 6 μ, exhibited an excellent thermal stability until 400°C and a very good fiber-to-fiber and batch-to-batch repeatability with RSD lower than 6\%. Finally, the capabilities of the developed coating for the selective sampling of aromatic hydrocarbons were proved, obtaining LOD values in the subnanogram per liter range.

	abstract = {The application of a hybrid multivariate curve resolution method, which combines evolving factor analysis (EFA) with alternating least squares (ALS), to the analysis of partially overlapping peaks from vapors measured by a microsensor-array gas chromatograph detector is described. The detector comprised an array of four chemiresistors coated with different sorptive thiolate-monolayer-protected gold nanoparticle (MPN) films. Three pairs of vapors, the members of which had array response pattern correlation coefficients, ρ, ranging from −0.57 to 0.85, were tested at different values of chromatographic resolution, Rs, and relative response ratio, RRR. Composite responses were equivalent to the sums of the responses to the individual components, but differences in peak asymmetry among the sensors in the array led to pattern distortions across the spans of all peaks. With data pre-processing to account for the latter, EFA correctly determined the chemical ranks of the binary composite peaks in 57 of the 63 cases (90\%), with most errors observed for the most highly correlated pair. By using calibrated response patterns as inputs for the ALS refinements of EFA-extracted responses, the fidelity of recovered response patterns and elution profiles was sufficiently high to differentiate the composite peak components in 124 of 126 cases (98\%) and to quantify them to within ±30\% of actual values in 95 of 126 (75\%) cases. Without such inputs, the corresponding rates were 112 of 126 (89\%) and 68 of 126 (54\%), respectively. In general, the RRR value was a more important determinant of performance than was the Rs value. The methodology and performance of EFA-ALS in this application are critically assessed.},

In this report, an enhanced sensing response towards ammonia at near room temperatures using Au decorated ZnO nanorods (NR) is reported in comparison to pristine ZnO NR of hexagonal wurtzite structure. A facile two step synthesis method is adopted involving hydrothermal synthesis for the preparation of high aspect ratio ZnO NR of 40 nm diameter and 100 nm length followed by chemical growth methods for nanoparticle Au decoration of 5 nm average particle size. UV-Visible Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy confirms presence of Au nanoparticles along with ZnO NR with characteristic surface plasmon resonance and ZnO exciton peak. Gas sensing studies revealed that the Au-decorated ZnO NR can detect ammonia even at 50°C and shows highest response at 100°C than pristine ZnO NR which shows a response maximum at 300°C.},

	abstract = {Objective Finely resolved PM2.5 exposure measurements at the level of individual participants or over a targeted geographic area can be challenging due to the cost, size and weight of the monitoring equipment. We propose re-purposing the low-cost, portable and lightweight Shinyei PPD42NS particle counter as a particle counting device. Previous field deployment of this sensor suggests that it captures trends in ambient PM2.5 concentrations, but important characteristics of the sensor response have yet to be determined. Laboratory testing was undertaken in order to characterize performance.   Methods The Shinyei sensors, in-line with a TSI Aerosol Particle Sizer (APS) model 3321, tracked particle decay within an aerosol exposure chamber. Test atmospheres were composed of monodisperse polystyrene spheres with diameters of 0.75, 1, 2 3 and 6 um as well as a polydisperse atmosphere of ASHRAE test dust \#1.   Results Two-minute block averages of the sensor response provide a measurement with low random error, within sensor, for particles in the 0.75–6μm range with a limit of detection of 1 μg/m3. The response slope of the sensors is idiomatic, and each sensor requires a unique response curve. A linear model captures the sensor response for concentrations below 50 μg/m3 and for concentrations above 50 μg/m3 a non-linear function captures the response and saturates at 800 μg/m3. The Limit of Detection (LOD) is 1 μg/m3. The response time is on the order of minutes, making it appropriate for tracking short-term changes in concentration.   Conclusions When paired with prior evaluation, these sensors are appropriate for use as ambient particle counters for low and medium concentrations of respirable particles ({\textless} 100 ug/m3). Multiple sensors deployed over a spatial grid would provide valuable spatio-temporal variability in PM2.5 and could be used to validate exposure models. When paired with GPS tracking, these devices have the potential to provide time and space resolved exposure measurements for a large number of participants, thus increasing the power of a study.},

We investigate, here, the addition of a layer of MnO2 microparticles powder as a chemical filter for ozone in a commercial amperometric gas sensor. Experimental results show that a sensor equipped with an MnO2 powder filter is insensitive to O3 but gives a well-defined limited current signal when exposed to NO2. In contrast, an unfiltered sensor senses both gases with a defined sensitivity for each gas. We find that the use of a pair of sensors, with one of the sensors filtered and one unfiltered, allows the quantification of both O3 and NO2. However, the MnO2 filter confers some indirect NO cross-sensitivity to the filtered sensors. Further studies show that it is possible to minimize this unwanted cross-sensitivity by replacing the MnO2 microparticles powder filter by an MnO2/PTFE microparticle composite filter powder. We find that the developed sensors allow reproducible measurements, linear output with the concentration and significant O3 filter capacity for an extended period of time.},

Measurements were focused on ozone (O3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The performance evaluation showed that the CairClip O3/NO2 sensor provided a consistent measurement response to that of reference monitors (r2 = 0.79 in Houston; r2 = 0.72 in Denver) whereas the CairClip NO2 sensor measurements showed no agreement to reference measurements. The CairClip O3/NO2 sensor data from the citizen science sites compared favorably to measurements at nearby reference monitoring sites.

As stated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), "The size of particles is directly linked to their potential for causing health problems" [1].  At this date, the EPA enforces regulations concerning two particle size categories, PM2.5 and PM10, where the numerical designation refers to the size in micrometers (i.e. PM2.5 refers to particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter).  
This document will discuss the efforts made by this design team to validate the PM 2.5 measurements of the system against industrial grade monitors that are used at EPA facilities. 
PM 10  data was not available for comparisons and will need to be revisited at a later date.},

	abstract = {Health effects attributed to outdoor ﬁne particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) rank it among the risk factors with the highest health burdens in the world, annually accounting for over 3.2 million premature deaths and over 76 million lost disability-adjusted life years. Existing PM 2.5 monitoring infrastructure cannot, however, be used to resolve variations in ambient PM 2.5 concentrations with adequate spatial and temporal density, or with adequate coverage of human
time-activity patterns, such that the needs of modern exposure science and control can be met.
Small, inexpensive, and portable devices, relying on newly available off-the-shelf sensors, may facilitate the creation of PM 2.5 datasets with improved resolution and coverage, especially if many such devices can be deployed concurrently with low system cost.
Datasets generated with such technology could be used to overcome many important problems associated with exposure misclassiﬁcation in air pollution epidemiology. Chapter 2 presents an epidemiological study of PM 2.5 that used data from ambient monitoring stations
in the Los Angeles basin to observe a decrease of 6.1g (95\% CI: 3.5, 8.7) in population mean birthweight following in utero exposure to the Southern California wildﬁres of 2003, but was otherwise limited by the sparsity of the empirical basis for exposure assessment. Chapter 3 demonstrates technical potential for remedying PM 2.5 monitoring deﬁciencies, beginning with the generation of low-cost yet useful estimates of hourly and daily PM 2.5 concentrations at a
regulatory monitoring site. The context (an urban neighborhood proximate to a major goods-movement corridor) and the method (an off-the-shelf sensor costing approximately USD \$10, combined with other low-cost, open-source, readily available hardware) were selected to have special signiﬁcance among researchers and practitioners afﬁliated with contemporary communities of practice in public health and citizen science. As operationalized by correlation with 1h data from a Federal Equivalent Method (FEM) β-attenuation data, prototype instruments performed as well as commercially available equipment costing considerably more, and as well
as another reference instrument under similar conditions at the same timescale (R2 ≈ 0.6).
Correlations were stronger when 24h integrating times were used instead (R 2 = 0.72).Chapter 4 replicates and extends the results of Chapter 3, showing that similar calibrations may be reasonably exchangeable between near-roadway and background monitoring sites.
Chapter 4 also employs triplicate sensors to obtain data consistent with near-ﬁeld ({\textless}50m) observations of plumes from a major highway (I-880). At 1 minute timescales, maximum PM 2.5 concentrations on the order of 100µgm −3 to 200µgm −3 were observed, commensurate with the magnitude of plumes from wildﬁres on longer timescales, as well as the magnitude of plumes that might be expected near other major highways on the same timescale. Finally,
Chapter 4 quantiﬁes variance among calibration parameters for a large sample of the sensors, as well as the error associated with the remote transfer of calibrations between two sufﬁciently large sets (± 10\% for n = 12). These ﬁndings suggest that datasets generated with similar sensors could also improve upstream scientiﬁc understandings of ﬂuxes resulting from indoor and outdoor emissions, atmospheric transformations, and transport, and may also facilitate timely and empirical veriﬁcation of interventions to reduce emissions and exposures, in many important contexts (e.g., the provision of improved cookstoves; congestion pricing; mitigation policies attached to inﬁll development; etc.). They also demonstrate that calibrations against continuous reference monitoring equipment could be  remotely transferred, within practical tolerances, to reasonably sized and adequately resourced participatory monitoring campaigns, with minimal risk of disruption to existing monitoring infrastructure (i.e., established monitoring sites). Given a collaborator with a short window of access to a reference monitoring site, this would overcome a nominally important barrier associated with non-gravimetric, in-situ calibration of continuous PM 2.5 monitors. Progressive and disruptive prospects linked to a proliferation of comparable sensing technologies based on commodity hardware are discussed in Chapter 5.},

	abstract = {The 1st EuNetAir Air Quality Joint Intercomparison Exercise organized in Aveiro (Portugal) from 13th–27th October 2014, focused on the evaluation and assessment of environmental gas, particulate matter (PM) and meteorological microsensors, versus standard air quality reference methods through an experimental urban air quality monitoring campaign. The IDAD-Institute of Environment and Development Air Quality Mobile Laboratory was placed at an urban traffic location in the city centre of Aveiro to conduct continuous measurements with standard equipment and reference analysers for CO, NOx, O3, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, solar radiation and precipitation.

The comparison of the sensor data generated by different microsensor-systems installed side-by-side with reference analysers, contributes to the assessment of the performance and the accuracy of microsensor-systems in a real-world context, and supports their calibration and further development.

The overall performance of the sensors in terms of their statistical metrics and measurement profile indicates significant differences in the results depending on the platform and on the sensors considered. In terms of pollutants, some promising results were observed for O3 (r2: 0.12–0.77), CO (r2: 0.53–0.87), and NO2 (r2: 0.02–0.89). For PM (r2: 0.07–0.36) and SO2 (r2: 0.09–0.20) the results show a poor performance with low correlation coefficients between the reference and microsensor measurements. These field observations under specific environmental conditions suggest that the relevant microsensor platforms, if supported by the proper post processing and data modelling tools, have enormous potential for new strategies in air quality control.},

The system is not only able to discriminate steady state conditions but also to correctly classify the transient behavior immediately after exposing the sensor to fuel vapor or ambient air. Integrated in pump nozzles at filling stations the system would allow to prevent the car tank from being filled with the wrong fuel by detecting the type of fuel inside the tank in seconds. For this application micro pellistors are also suitable, which have shown superior stability compared to semiconductor gas sensors.},

SnO2 thick film sensors, with a thickness of approximately 10 μm, were prepared by a conventional screen printing method. The films were printed on interdigitated Pt electrodes deposited on the front side of an Al2O3 substrate and a Pt heater was deposited on the backside of the substrate. Gas-sensing measurements were carried out using 20\% O2/N2 with a few ppm NO2 gas flow. The temperature of the sensor was changed in steps of 100 °C from 100 to 400 °C, and kept constant for 2 min at each step using an electronic control circuit. A reference sensor fabricated in ZnSb2O6 was also prepared and measured by the same method. In addition, the adsorption and desorption characteristics of the gas-sensing material for NO2 were examined by doing temperature programmed desorption (TPD) measurements.

The resistance decreased as the temperature increased, and increased when NO2 was present. The transient response in NO2 had a peaked point between 200 and 300 °C. On the other hand, no peak response was observed for the ZnSb2O6 sensor. As seen from the TPD measurements, the desorbed NO2 from SnO2 was much higher than that from ZnSb2O6, therefore, the peak response of the SnO2 sensor seems to be related to the adsorption and desorption properties of the gas-sensing material.},

Nowadays metal oxide gas sensors of the tin oxide type are preferably used as sensor elements due to their good sensitivity, long-term functionality and low application costs. In general, however, a still unsolved problem of automatic safety control by monitoring of flammable and hazardous gases in air is the gas identification capability and the reliability of this type of sensor at changing temperature and humidity conditions. In the case of ammonia used as coolant medium we present a novel and economic sensor system which enables both ammonia identification and concentration determination under variing air humidity. This will reduce the risk of false alarms drastically.},

Different measurement conditions were set by the cycle time, the gas flow rate, the humidity and the thickness of the sensitive layer. The sensor response is expressed by the conductance-over-time profiles (CTPs), the gas sensitivity or by the sum of the CTP sampling points. The resultant sensitivities from the CTPs were found to be higher than those of the isothermal measurements. The CTPs considerably change with the kind of gas as well as with the variation of the measurement conditions. This is discussed for both types of target gases with respect to the temperature, the adsorbates assumed and the reaction kinetics in relation to the gas transport conditions in the porous gas sensitive layer.},

	abstract = {Vehicle exhaust is a major source of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) in metropolitan cities. Popular community mode (buses and taxies) and about 2.4 million private cars are the main emission sources of air pollution in Tehran. A case survey has conducted to measure CO2 in four popular vehicles, bus, taxi, private car and motorcycle, which moved in the city with respectively 7800, 82358, 560000 and 2.4 million per day in 2012. Results indicated that the contribution of CO2 emissions increased in the following order: private car, motorcycle, bus and taxi. The overall average for the contribution of CO2 emissions in the private car, motorcycle, bus, and taxi were 26372, 1648, 1433 and 374 tons per day, respectively. Our results also showed that the urban transport operation consume an estimated 178 and 4224 million liter diesel and petrol per year, respectively, that have released about 10 million tons of CO2. The average contribution of CO2 emissions of private cars in Tehran was higher (88\%) than other vehicles. It was concluded that high volume of traffic, transport consumption of fossil fuels and shortage of adequate public transport system are responsible for the high CO2 level in environment in Tehran. Thus, it is to be expected that CO2 as a greenhouse gas has risen in Tehran more than ever in the following years and this would be a matter of concern for the authorities to have a comprehensive plan to mitigate this phenomena.},

	abstract = {The air pollution induced by urban traffic has addressed much attention in recent years as the rapid urbanization and the fast increase of vehicle number in urban area. In this study, we attempted to investigate the dispersion behavior of exhaust gas from exhaust pipe using computational fluid dynamics approach. The time-averaged CO2 concentration, velocity and temperature profiles along the centerline of the vehicular exhaust plume were simulated in varied situations. The computational results showed good agreement with the experimental data and the numerical model was validated to be an effective method to investigate the pollutant dispersion in the near-wake region of a vehicle. Based on it, the numerical simulations were extended to explore the impacts of the emit concentration, the emit direction and the incoming velocity on the flow dynamics and CO2 dispersion. The outputs indicated that the emit concentration could change the pollution level in the near-wake region of a vehicle and the emit direction may alter the spreading direction of the vehicular exhaust plume. The incoming velocity was found to have dominant influence on the dispersion of pollutant due to induced vortices and turbulence behind the vehicle. These findings are expected to provide important insight into evaluating the design and control strategies for alleviating mobile source emissions. © 2016 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg},

Several significant CO2 fluxes in nature may still be unknown as illustrated by recent findings of high CO2 emissions from aquatic environments, previously not recognized in global carbon balances. Therefore, it is important to develop convenient and affordable ways to measure CO2 in many types of environments. At present, direct measurements of CO2 fluxes from soil or water, or CO2 concentrations in surface water, are typically labor intensive or require costly equipment. We here present an approach with measurement units based on small inexpensive CO2 loggers, originally made for indoor air quality monitoring, that were tested and adapted for field use. Measurements of soil–atmosphere and lake–atmosphere fluxes, as well as of spatiotemporal dynamics of water CO2 concentrations (expressed as the equivalent partial pressure, pCO2aq) in lakes and a stream network are provided as examples. Results from all these examples indicate that this approach can provide a cost- and labor-efficient alternative for direct measurements and monitoring of CO2 flux and pCO2aq in terrestrial and aquatic environments.},

	url = {http://www2.epa.gov/air-research/air-sensor-toolbox-citizen-scientists-resources#TER},
	abstract = {Background
Particulate matter (PM) is a pollutant of high public interest regulated by national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) using federal reference method (FRM) and federal equivalent method (FEM) instrumentation identified for environmental monitoring. PM is present in the atmosphere in concentrations that can vary greatly according to location, temperature, and a number of circumstances that influence local air quality. Citizen scientists and other researchers have a desire to monitor this pollutant, and there is a need for increased accessibility to portable and economical monitoring and sampling equipment. The evolution of low cost PM sensors has resulted in a number of such instruments becoming commercially available. However, this evaluation was not conducted to assess the suitability of these PM sensors to serve as either FRM or FEM sampler instruments. This activity represents the first step in evaluating some of the commercially available low cost PM sensors and comparing their data-collection capabilities to that of collocated FEM samplers during field evaluations.
Study Objectives
As part of its Air Climate \& Energy (ACE) research program on emerging technologies (ACE EM-3), the US EPA developed a research effort with the goals of: conducting a world-wide market survey of low cost PM sensors ({\textless}\$2500), acquiring such sensors, and then conducting collocated field evaluations of these sensors in direct comparison with FEM instrumentation. A total of eight such devices were obtained and sited in the established PM sensor test platform on the US EPA’s RTP, NC campus (AIRS). The collocated PM2.5 FEM instrumentation with 5-minute time resolution provided the means to investigate both short duration and daily (24-hr) comparisons between the test devices and the FEM response. Potential data confounders such as temperature and relative humidity were obtained to aid in the investigation. The relationship between FEM response and the various sensors was established in a regression. Ancillary findings related to ease of use, portability, data collection efficiency, among others, were established based upon our experiences over approximately one month of continuous operation.
Study Approach
Direct manufacturer contact, as well as internet searches, surfaced eight prospective low cost sensors meriting incorporation into this study. In some instances, sensor developers contacted the research team and expressed interest in having their device evaluated. Any device accepted under such conditions was incorporated without restrictions or direct involvement of the developer. Despite there being a large number of PM sensors on the market, many appeared to lack specific properties that discouraged us from incorporating them into the research. We focused on sensors that demonstrated direct reading, provided either true or estimated size cut point data (preferably PM2.5), and were responsive to at least some outdoor monitoring. Not
xiii
every sensor that was evaluated met these criteria. Recent sensor-related conferences hosted by EPA1 and other scientific exchanges (including peer review literature2,3) clearly indicated that PM sensors reporting only particle number (or counts) were both available at low cost and may prove comparable to more expensive light scattering (nephelometric) and direct mass measuring (Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance-TEOM) instrumentation. A number of these devices were secured and evaluated to meet the apparent growing use rate among both research professionals and citizen scientists.
Concerning outdoor monitoring applications, only one of the sensors evaluated came fully weather protected, and allowances (shelters) were developed to protect the remaining devices. In several instances, the sensor developers expressed that their devices were primarily intended for indoor monitoring. Regardless of how a manufacturer defines the applicability of a given low cost PM sensor, it is highly likely that citizen scientists and others would try to use such devices to the greatest extent possible while perhaps ignoring cautions about primary siting requirements. Outdoor monitoring is a prime example of such a scenario, and was therefore fully assimilated into the study design. As a result, one might consider the performance characteristics defined in this report as potentially representing a worst-case scenario. Regardless, we protected all sensors from weather conditions (ambient temperature, moisture, stray light) to the best of our ability.
For approximately one month, these collocated low cost sensors were cited on a PM monitor test platform with a Grimm Model EDM180 PM2.5 (EQPM-0311-195) FEM on the US EPA’s RTP, NC campus. The units operated continuously during this time with the exception of data recovery, flow checks/calibration, and general servicing as required by the various manufacturers. Once the monitoring period was completed, data from the FEM, sensors and meteorological findings were compared to determine how these variables influence low cost sensor response.
Sensor Performance Results
Discreet statistical evaluation of sensor performance was established with respect to collocated data associated with the Grimm FEM. When possible, resulting regression characteristics were optimized with respect to data normalization and influence of confounders.

Ease of Use Features Evaluation
Concerning ease of use features, several key findings were evident. In general, these included, but were not limited to:
 Power Requirements: None of the units tested had the ability to operate for extensive (multi-day) periods without electrical assistance. Since our goal was to obtain as much collocated data as possible, we purposefully removed such a variable (battery life) from the research. That being said, certain sensors required specific power supplies (such as a USB computer connection), while others simply required a ‘step-down’ 115V transformer. Upon battery power alone, the sensors would expect to operate from 8 hours to 3 days, depending upon sensor type.
 Data collection/transmission/storage/recovery: There were numerous data collection/transmission/storage/recovery approaches observed between the various sensor devices. Therefore, extensive efforts had to be performed to ensure data recovery to perform the evaluations. Cellular communication, WiFi hot spots, direct storage via laptops, or electronic tablet connections had to be established, developed, or in some cases unexpectedly refined as to the manufacturer’s suggested protocols. Data communication issues had to be fully vetted to ensure both consistent and reliable data recovery.
 Data Schemes: Data schemas were widely variable between the sensors evaluated. This lack of standardization across manufacturers and the often-unique pattern of their data formatting (and the types of data being reported) made data recovery and insertion into statistical analysis schema somewhat difficult. Individual data recovery programs often had to be established for each sensor so that data could be recovered. In some instances, communication with the developer was necessary to understand what their output was so that we could correctly identify variables for analysis.
 Installation and WiFi considerations: Almost all of the low cost sensors were easy to install following our development of weather-shielded assemblies. Their low mass and small sizes were highly advantageous for siting. Even so, all of the units had to have external power supplies. Some of the sensors required direct computer connections, which in our opinion minimizes its capabilities relative to outdoor use. Even so, it should be recognized that manufacturers are not necessarily trying to market these as outdoor-worthy PM samplers. It cannot be underestimated that when used outdoors, establishment of data communication can be difficult, especially if cellular communication or a local WiFi hot spot is required. In our situation, we were able to establish a local WiFi hot spot or other needed communication requirements. We sometimes had to work directly with a manufacturer to develop digital data storage internal to the unit or via other means such as transferrable data storage card when necessary to ensure sufficient data recovery for our purpose.
Sensor Performance Characteristics
With rare exception, most of the low cost PM sensors demonstrated an ability to provide at least some short duration response variability (some on the order of 1 second). Data clearly indicated that time weighted averages of approximately one to 5 minutes are more acceptable when it came to end users being able to understand the general response encountered by the simple noise of the instrument itself.

 Precision: Only the MicroPEM was evaluated for precision capabilities. Three collocated sensors were operated for a period of approximately one month and their general inter-variability established.
 Linearity: The sensors typically provided coefficient of determination (R2) in comparison with FEM measures of {\textless} 0.8. In a number of situations, there was little or no statistical agreement (R2 {\textless} 0.1). Estimates of either particle count or algorithm-based mass concentrations (μg/m3) were equally capable of reasonable FEM agreement or equal lack of agreement. Since all algorithm-based mass concentration estimates are only as good as the base light scattering determination itself, it would appear that much of the lack of agreement probably lies with the latter. As established by the design of the field studies reported here, a reasonable estimation of mass concentration from particle counts could have been established for one of the sensors (Dylos DC1100).
 Relative Humidity and Temperature Changes: There was wide disparity in the response of individual sensors to extremes of either RH or temperature challenge. Both minimal impacts as well as extreme impacts were observed as they relate to the sensors successfully reporting the challenge concentrations as environmental conditions changed. Some of this was expected due to the very nature of the sensing mechanism (approach) often employed in low cost sensors. Considering that all of the sensors tested were based upon light scattering principles where particle hydroscopic properties are known to be an influencing factor in mass concentration estimation, it is uncertain why such a wide range in RH influence (as noted by R2 relationships) were obtained. Likewise, some sensors were highly collinear with respect to changes in outdoor temperature while others showed no such relationship.
 Response Range: Response range of the sensors varied widely. It was not unusual to see multiple order of magnitude differences between sensors and the concentrations they were reporting. It should be clearly stated here that environmental impacts of relative humidity and temperature are often a significant influence in sensor response (light scattering). RH was not accounted for with sensor algorithms, with only one exception (MicroPEM), and therefore a widespread variety of responses with changing meteorological conditions was to be expected. Light scattering optics, cell geometry, and other key engineering features are known to be highly influential relative to nephelometric response and therefore the variability observed here in the findings reflects not only the physics of light scattering devices in general, but also how such features have or have not been incorporated into these low cost devices.
Conclusions
While both the discreet performance characteristics and ease of use characteristics for each device were highly variable, some of the devices appeared to provide reasonable agreement with the collocated FEM mass concentration estimates. The frequent lack of agreement between the sensor and the FEM is a clear indication that citizen scientists and others employing such devices (especially under outdoor monitoring conditions) must remain aware of the uncertainty surrounding the data being generated. At times, meteorological conditions (temperature, RH) had a significant impact upon low cost sensor responses and it was necessary to remove some data to improve the performance statistics. It should be noted that the end users of these devices need to understand where data exclusion might be necessary, as often little or no instructions on such
xvi
matters are clearly defined by the sensor manufacturers. It would appear that collocation in the general test area would provide a reasonable approach for end users to ascertain the ability of a low cost sensor to be provide useable data. The information provided in this report represents a first step towards ensuring that the next generation of low cost air quality sensors has even more capabilities, meeting a wide variety of air quality monitoring needs. The study also provides potential low cost sensor users with key information regarding sensor performance and the criteria that must be addressed in order to collect data successfully.},

	abstract = {This report summarizes the results of low cost air quality sensor performance trials conducted in the NERL’s on-site laboratories located in Research Triangle Park, NC during 2012-2013.   Such trials were viewed as highly valuable for all parties following the conclusion of the U.S. EPA’s Air Sensor and APPs conference conducted in the spring of 2012.  Conference attendees from a wide range of interests (government, sensor development, citizen scientists, etc) concluded that basic sensor performance characteristics of available sensor 
technologies were unknown.  Many potential users of these technologies were unaware that data quality needed to be established or how one might perform such determinations.  Many conference attendees shared that the U.S. EPA needed to take a leadership role to both 
educate sensor developers and end users about needed performance standards, share technical information about how one would establish such characteristics, and foster continuing dialogue between all interested parties on this subject matter.    
As a result of the aforementioned conclusion, the U.S. EPA initiated a research program 
in the summer of 2012 to survey sensor developers about potential technology-sharing with the 
ultimate goal of conducting exhaustive laboratory-based sensor performance trials.  
Collaborating institutions responded to an open, web-based invitation to submit applications to 
participate.  Applicant screening was performed that ensured the sensors being offered for 
evaluation were available to others for use and that they had not been previously examined via 
any third-party laboratory.  In addition, there had to be a lack of publically-available information 
on sensor performance for inclusion in the research. 
A total of nine institutions of multi-national origin agreed to establish confidential 
MCRADA research with the U.S. EPA associated with the performance of O 3  and NO 2  gas 
phase air quality sensors.  These sensor types were selected due to their prevalence in the 
market place and the availability of established test regimens that might be applied.  Findings 
associated with sensors shared by seven of these parties are described in this report and are 
being voluntarily shared here by the collaborating institutions.  These institutions were a 
combination of academic, private sector, and non-profit organizations that had responded to the 
open challenge of participating in exhaustive laboratory-based trials of basic sensor 
performance characteristics.   
Performance traits such as response linearity, response reaction times, detection limit, 
and response to interfering agents, among others were established.  In addition, characteristics 
important to potential users such as battery life, ease of operation, data storage and/or 
communication protocols were investigated.  Laboratory data were collected using an exposure 
chamber linked with either Federal Reference Method (FRM) or Federal Equivalent Method 
(FEM) instrumentation.  Sensors were individually challenged using a variety of test conditions 
and their resulting response recorded.  Replicate trials of each challenge were performed to 
provide needed statistical strength in establishing performance. 
Select findings from these trials are as follows: 
(1) Many of these sensors, having commercial values of {\textless} \$1000, demonstrate some 
performance characteristics that often rival those of FRM/FEM instrumentation. The sensors 
often exhibited very fast response times with minimal rise and lag times which suggests 
potential use for continuous or near-continuous environmental monitoring.  
(2) Many of the sensors had a high degree of linearity over their full response range at 
concentrations often well above normally observed environmental concentrations. 
(3) While the sensors often did not have the detection limits as low as FRM/FEM 
instrumentation, they often achieved levels near these concentrations that would appear to 
meet a wide variety of environmentally-relevant monitoring needs. 
(4) Some of the sensors revealed some unwanted co-response to interfering agents (e.g., NO 2 , 
O 3 , SO 2 ).  Likewise, extremes of RH and temperature often resulted in some undesirable 
response characteristics. 
(5) Establishment of data collection/recovery protocols involved a wide array of approaches to 
achieve success (e.g., WiFi hot spots, cellular telephone, SD card, proprietary web data 
portals).  This often involved iterative upgrades to communication protocols, hardware and 
other integrated systems as testing was initiated on each device.},

	abstract = {Measurements at appropriate spatial and temporal scales are essential for understanding and monitoring spatially heterogeneous environments with complex and highly variable emission sources, such as in urban areas. However, the costs and complexity of conventional air quality measurement methods means that measurement networks are generally extremely sparse. In this paper we show that miniature, low-cost electrochemical gas sensors, traditionally used for sensing at parts-per-million (ppm) mixing ratios can, when suitably configured and operated, be used for parts-per-billion (ppb) level studies for gases relevant to urban air quality. Sensor nodes, in this case consisting of multiple individual electrochemical sensors, can be low-cost and highly portable, thus allowing the deployment of scalable high-density air quality sensor networks at fine spatial and temporal scales, and in both static and mobile configurations.

In this paper we provide evidence for the performance of electrochemical sensors at the parts-per-billion level, and then outline results obtained from deployments of networks of sensor nodes in both an autonomous, high-density, static network in the wider Cambridge (UK) area, and as mobile networks for quantification of personal exposure. Examples are presented of measurements obtained with both highly portable devices held by pedestrians and cyclists, and static devices attached to street furniture. The widely varying mixing ratios reported by this study confirm that the urban environment cannot be fully characterised using sparse, static networks, and that measurement networks with higher resolution (both spatially and temporally) are required to quantify air quality at the scales which are present in the urban environment. We conclude that the instruments described here, and the low-cost/high-density measurement philosophy which underpins it, have the potential to provide a far more complete assessment of the high-granularity air quality structure generally observed in the urban environment, and could ultimately be used for quantification of human exposure as well as for monitoring and legislative purposes.},

This method is generally more successful than the calibration in exposure chambers under controlled conditions because of the difference between laboratory and fields air matrixes. To expand this result, we carried out an experiment at two sampling sites. At the first site, the microsensors were calibrated during a few days. Subsequently, the calibrated microsensors were taken to another sampling site where the effectiveness of the calibration function of the first site was evaluated. The trend of the differences between UV photometry and microsensors were analyzed to evidence possible drift of the microsensors over time. The correlation of these differences with meteorological data was investigated to evidence possible interference and to propose new calibration methods.},

	abstract = {Air quality monitoring is extremely important as air pollution has a direct impact on human health. Low-cost gas sensors are used to effectively perceive the environment by mounting them on top of mobile vehicles, for example, using a public transport network. Thus, these sensors are part of a mobile network and perform from time to time measurements in each others vicinity. In this paper, we study three calibration algorithms that exploit co-located sensor measurements to enhance sensor calibration and consequently the quality of the pollution measurements on-the-fly. Forward calibration, based on a traditional approach widely used in the literature, is used as performance benchmark for two novel algorithms: backward and instant calibration. We validate all three algorithms with real ozone pollution measurements carried out in an urban setting by comparing gas sensor output to high-quality measurements from analytical instruments. We find that both backward and instant calibration reduce the average measurement error by a factor of two compared to forward calibration. Furthermore, we unveil the arising difficulties if sensor calibration is not based on reliable reference measurements but on sensor readings of low-cost gas sensors which is inevitable in a mobile scenario with only a few reliable sensors. We propose a solution and evaluate its effect on the measurement accuracy in experiments and simulation.},

A recent review can be found in [Sens. Actuators B 60 (1999) 35]. We present an array composed of two commercial metal oxide gas sensors allowing discrimination of six organic solvents over a wide concentration range from 2 to 200 ppm in air. Temperature cycling reduces sensor baseline drift considerably over a test period of several months. Additional signal pre-processing suppresses the influence of humidity and leads to further drift reduction. The system comprises a hierarchical pattern classification evaluating shape features generated from the sensor response curve during temperature cycling, which are compared with other feature generation methods (like FFT and wavelet, see also [Sens. Actuators B 41 (1997) 105]). The classification requires comparatively little computing power and allows flexible adaptation to different operating environments, for example, to suppress false alarms from interfering gases.
Reproducibility of sensor performance was checked using four systems with identical sensors. The same features can be used for the classification with all systems but the areas for classification have to be adapted to the individual sensors.},

The use of gas sensors can contribute to reach such objectives. At the moment, the performances of the gas sensors available on the market especially SnO2 sensors are often not sufficient to satisfy these needs. The major limitations are dependent on their poor selectivity and stability. Some examples of such problems are presented through field experiments in both types of applications and some feasible improvements of the sensors are discussed. In urban pollution monitoring, it is necessary to take into account the irreversible action of SO2. The dual response to oxidising or reducing gases is a difficult problem to solve, especially for the NOx gases. Solutions with metallic filters above the sensing material are currently studied. In order to be able to use directly the sensors in the car exhausts, new types of sensors are developed mainly on the basis of electrochemical devices. An example of such new sensor is exposed with experimental results obtained on car exhausts.},

Baseline drift of the sensor, which occurs on a time scale of hours, can be compensated by periodic correction using sample air scrubbed free of oxidants. Interfering gases expected are nitrogen dioxide and nitrous acid. The latter can be removed with a sodium carbonate-glycerol filter, but a chemical filter that can remove nitrogen dioxide in the presence of ozone is not known. However, filters containing indigo can be used to remove ozone from an air stream without affecting the NO2. Selective and sensitive measurement of ozone was achieved by using two matched sensors connected in series, with an indigo filter between. The first sensor measured ozone plus nitrogen dioxide, whereas the second sensor was exposed only to NO2. The ozone signal is the difference in the two signals.},

Due to electron donation from SiC, single layer graphene is n-type with a very low carrier concentration. The choice of substrate is demonstrated to enable tailoring of the electronic properties of graphene, with a SiC substrate realising simple resistive devices tuned for extremely sensitive NO2 detection. The gas exposed uppermost layer of the multi layer device is screened from the SiC by the intermediate layers leading to a p-type nature with a higher concentration of charge carriers and therefore, a lower gas response. The single layer graphene device is thought to undergo an nâ€“p transition upon exposure to increasing concentrations of NO2 indicated by a change in response direction. This transition is likely to be due to the transfer of electrons to NO2 making holes the majority carriers.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the development of a gas sensor system to be used as a sensing node to form a dense real-time environmental monitoring network. Moreover, a new auto-calibration method is proposed to achieve the maintenance-free operation of the sensor network. The network connectivity can be used not only for data collection but also for the calibration and diagnosis of the sensors since the measured pollutant concentrations can be easily compared through the network with nearby sensors and governmental monitoring stations. Different pollutant concentrations are usually monitored at different sites. However, a case study on local NO2 distribution has shown that there exists a special condition under which pollutant concentrations become low and uniform in a certain local area. The baseline of the gas sensor response can be adjusted in this special occasion using the pollutant concentration values reported from the neighboring environmental monitoring stations. The experimental result has shown that NO2 concentration can be measured with sufficient accuracy by incorporating appropriate temperature and humidity compensation into calibration curves. Moreover, a case study on auto-calibration demonstrates its effectiveness in keeping the measurement accuracy of the sensor system in long-term operation.},

	abstract = {The monitoring of atmospheric pollution using chemical gas sensors is a challenge due to the lack of selectivity of most existing devices. However, their performances can be improved using filtering films achieving the separation or the removal of some gases. This study is focused on the detection of carbon monoxide and of oxidant pollutants (nitrogen dioxide and ozone) by sensors constituted of SnO2, or phthalocyanine compounds. Two types of filters were investigated. Filters based on MnO2 powder are successful to remove ozone while preserving nitrogen dioxide in a large temperature range from ambient to 400 Â°C, but they partially convert carbon monoxide. The second type of filter constituted of indigo powder is also efficient to remove ozone without modification of nitrogen concentration at ambient. Then, these filters were associated with sensing element. MnO2 thick films were deposited by screen-printing on SnO2. With resulting sensors, the interference of ozone for the detection of CO or of NO2 is reduced, but some technological problems such as adhesion of MnO2 layer have to be solved. For phthalocyanine devices, the indigo filter placed upstream to the sensitive layer makes the sensor selective to nitrogen dioxide.},

The sensing system was evaluated and calibrated under laboratory conditions with two different VOCs transfer methods: dynamic and static. The sensing unit calibration deals with changes of VOCs and/or humidity concentration and temperature variations, simulating the real industrial environment. Finally the WSS was placed in the workspace of a printed flexing packaging industrial installation and comparison with the already installed commercial detectors was performed. A very good agreement between the results of the two measurement systems is demonstrated. Additionally these results showed that the WSS is characterized by fast response with high repeatability and long-term stability. Concluding, this system is suitable for the targeted application.},

	abstract = {Low-cost air quality sensors offer high-resolution spatiotemporal measurements that can be used for air resources management and exposure estimation. Yet, such sensors require frequent calibration to provide reliable data, since even after a laboratory calibration they might not report correct values when they are deployed in the field, due to interference with other pollutants, as a result of sensitivity to environmental conditions and due to sensor aging and drift. Field calibration has been suggested as a means for overcoming these limitations, with the common strategy involving periodical collocations of the sensors at an air quality monitoring station. However, the cost and complexity involved in relocating numerous sensor nodes back and forth, and the loss of data during the repeated calibration periods make this strategy inefficient. This work examines an alternative approach, a node-to-node (N2N) calibration, where only one sensor in each chain is directly calibrated against the reference measurements and the rest of the sensors are calibrated sequentially one against the other while they are deployed and collocated in pairs. The calibration can be performed multiple times as a routine procedure. This procedure minimizes the total number of sensor relocations, and enables calibration while simultaneously collecting data at the deployment sites. We studied N2N chain calibration and the propagation of the calibration error analytically, computationally and experimentally. The in-situ N2N calibration is shown to be generic and applicable for different pollutants, sensing technologies, sensor platforms, chain lengths, and sensor order within the chain. In particular, we show that chain calibration of three nodes, each calibrated for a week, propagate calibration errors that are similar to those found in direct field calibration. Hence, N2N calibration is shown to be suitable for calibration of distributed sensor networks.},

	abstract = {Low-cost sensing strategies hold the promise of denser air quality monitoring networks, which could significantly improve our understanding of personal air pollution exposure. Additionally, low-cost air quality sensors could be deployed to areas where limited monitoring exists. However, low-cost sensors are frequently sensitive to environmental conditions and pollutant cross-sensitivities, which have historically been poorly addressed by laboratory calibrations, limiting their utility for monitoring. In this study, we investigated different calibration models for the Real-time Affordable Multi-Pollutant (RAMP) sensor package, which measures CO, NO2, O3, and CO2. We explored three methods: (1) laboratory univariate linear regression, (2) empirical multiple linear regression, and (3) machine-learning-based calibration models using random forests (RF). Calibration models were developed for 16–19 RAMP monitors (varied by pollutant) using training and testing windows spanning August 2016 through February 2017 in Pittsburgh, PA, US. The random forest models matched (CO) or significantly outperformed (NO2, CO2, O3) the other calibration models, and their accuracy and precision were robust over time for testing windows of up to 16 weeks. Following calibration, average mean absolute error on the testing data set from the random forest models was 38 ppb for CO (14 \% relative error), 10 ppm for CO2 (2 \% relative error), 3.5 ppb for NO2 (29 \% relative error), and 3.4 ppb for O3 (15 \% relative error), and Pearson r versus the reference monitors exceeded 0.8 for most units. Model performance is explored in detail, including a quantification of model variable importance, accuracy across different concentration ranges, and performance in a range of monitoring contexts including the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and the US EPA Air Sensors Guidebook recommendations of minimum data quality for personal exposure measurement. A key strength of the RF approach is that it accounts for pollutant cross-sensitivities. This highlights the importance of developing multipollutant sensor packages (as opposed to single-pollutant monitors); we determined this is especially critical for NO2 and CO2. The evaluation reveals that only the RF-calibrated sensors meet the US EPA Air Sensors Guidebook recommendations of minimum data quality for personal exposure measurement. We also demonstrate that the RF-model-calibrated sensors could detect differences in NO2 concentrations between a near-road site and a suburban site less than 1.5 km away. From this study, we conclude that combining RF models with carefully controlled state-of-the-art multipollutant sensor packages as in the RAMP monitors appears to be a very promising approach to address the poor performance that has plagued low-cost air quality sensors.},

	abstract = {Low-cost, light-scattering-based particulate matter (PM) sensors are becoming more widely available and are being increasingly deployed in ambient and indoor environments because of their low cost and ability to provide high spatial and temporal resolution PM information. Researchers have begun to evaluate some of these sensors under laboratory and environmental conditions. In this study, a low-cost, particulate matter sensor (Plantower PMS 1003/3003) used by a community air-quality network is evaluated in a controlled wind-tunnel environment and in the ambient environment during several winter-time, cold-pool events that are associated with high ambient levels of PM. In the wind-tunnel, the PMS sensor performance is compared to two research-grade, light-scattering instruments, and in the ambient tests, the sensor performance is compared to two federal equivalent (one tapered element oscillating microbalance and one beta attenuation monitor) and gravimetric federal reference methods (FEMs/FRMs) as well as one research-grade instrument (GRIMM). The PMS sensor response correlates well with research-grade instruments in the wind-tunnel tests, and its response is linear over the concentration range tested (200–850 μg/m3). In the ambient tests, this PM sensor correlates better with gravimetric methods than previous studies with correlation coefficients of 0.88. However additional measurements under a variety of ambient conditions are needed. Although the PMS sensor correlated as well as the research-grade instrument to the FRM/FEMs in ambient conditions, its response varies with particle properties to a much greater degree than the research-grade instrument. In addition, the PMS sensors overestimate ambient PM concentrations and begin to exhibit a non-linear response when PM2.5 concentrations exceed 40 μg/m3. These results have important implications for communicating results from low-cost sensor networks, and they highlight the importance of using an appropriate correction factor for the target environmental conditions if the user wants to compare the results to FEM/FRMs.},

For these reasons, in the last decade we assisted to a continuously increasing interest in the mobile monitoring of PM on a regional and a local scale. Here we summarize the current status in this field, outlining the critical issues and the perspectives. The growing availability of instruments designed and optimized to the real-time monitoring of the air quality, considerably increased the spatial and temporal resolution of available datasets, actually improving air pollution maps and forecast models. However, several issues are still unresolved, particularly in terms of data representativeness. Indeed, the future PM monitoring devices have to be designed to support the decisional process but also the management of environmental emergencies in urban and industrial areas. The future of these devices is certainly the development of compact systems that will make possible a real-time characterization of size distribution, morphology, and chemical composition of the airborne particles.},

To seek a simplified calibration method, we used four commercial CO2 sensor models and characterized their output tendencies against ambient temperature and length of use, in addition to offset characteristics. We used four samples of standard gas with different CO2 concentrations (0, 407, 1,110, and 1,810 ppm). The outputs of K30 and AN100 models showed linear relationships with temperature and length of use. Calibration coefficients for sensor models were determined using the data from three individual sensors of the same model to minimize the relative RMS error. When the correction was applied to the sensors, the accuracy of measurements improved significantly in the case of the K30 and AN100 units. In particular, in the case of K30 the relative RMS error decreased from 24\% to 4\%. Hence, we have chosen K30 for developing a portable CO2 measurement device (10 × 10 × 15 cm, 900 g). Data of CO2 concentration, measurement time and location, temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure can be recorded onto a Secure Digital (SD) memory card. The CO2 concentration in a high-school lecture room was monitored with this device. The CO2 data, when corrected for simultaneously measured temperature, water vapor partial pressure, and atmospheric pressure, showed a good agreement with the data measured by a highly accurate CO2 analyzer, LI-6262. This indicates that acceptable accuracy can be realized using the calibration method developed in this study.},

The detailed comparison was published in the article "Comparison of the Characteristics of Small Commercial NDIR CO2 Sensor Models and Development of a Portable CO2 Measurement Device" in the MDPI Open Access Journals Platform.
The authors wrote the article as the result of a study to determine if low cost NDIR CO2 sensors could be easily calibrated and were accurate enough to use in a low-cost portable device designed to record carbon dioxide levels from many locations in a large urban environment over time.
To conduct their experiment, the team purchased three copies of five different commercially available NDIR sensors and tested them in a classroom. In addition, they tested each sensor against four samples of standard gas with different CO2 concentrations. 
According to their results, "The outputs of K30 and AN100 models showed linear relationships with temperature and length of use.

	abstract = {Meteorological parameters such as relative humidity have a significant impact on the precision of PM2.5 measurement instruments based on light scattering. Instead of adding meteorological sensors or dehumidification devices used widely in commercial PM2.5 measurement instruments, a novel particle sensor based on multi-angle light scattering and data fusion is proposed to eliminate the effect of meteorological factors. Three photodiodes are employed to collect the scattered light flux at three distinct angles. Weather index is defined as the ratio of scattered light fluxes collected at the 40° and 55° angles, which can be used to distinguish the mass median diameter variation caused by different meteorological parameters. Simulations based on Lorenz-Mie theory and field experiments establish the feasibility of this scheme. Experimental results indicate that mass median diameter has less effect on the photodiode at the 55° angle in comparison with photodiodes at the 40° angle and 140° angle. After correction using the weather index, the photodiode at the 40° angle yielded the best results followed by photodiodes at the 55° angle and the 140° angle.},

	abstract = {On Field calibration is increasingly considered as the best performing approach for air quality monitor devices. Field recorded sensor data together with co-located reference data build suitable dataset that are more representative of the complexity of real world conditions. However, many researchers pointed out the possible lack of generalization due to the strong dependence on the condition encountered during the field recordings. This work, for the first time, try to assess the robustness of this approach to relocation of the sensor nodes. This is particular relevant for mobile deployments and for guaranteeing the scalability properties of this calibration approach in pervasive deployments. Neural Networks have been used to provide for a nonlinear multivariate calibration algorithm. An extensive dataset, recorded in Oslo during 2015-16, provided the ground for a multi-node/multi-weeks assessment. The observed differences account for a greater influence of seasonal changes on the performances with respect to relocation effects.},

A graphene sample is coupled to the evanescent field of a dielectric resonator whereupon nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), a p-doping gas, is detected by monitoring the change in the linewidth and frequency of the resonant mode. The resonant peak shape is dependent on the number of carriers in the graphene sheet. Therefore, the linewidth perturbation can be converted to a measurement of the graphene sheet resistance. To demonstrate the strength of this technique, sensor response curves for NO 2 at different concentrations and temperatures are measured showing sub ppm sensitivity. This technique eliminates interactions between the trace gas and metal contacts that otherwise effect the sensor response of the graphene device.},

	abstract = {It is commonly known that the conservation state of works of arts exhibited inside museums is strongly influenced by the indoor environmental quality (IEQ). Heritage institutions traditionally record and evaluate their IEQ by monitoring temperature, relative humidity, and -more rarely-light. However, smart use of technology enables monitoring other parameters that give a more complete insight in environmental ‘air aggressiveness’. One of this parameters is particulate matter (PM) and especially its concentration, size distribution and chemical composition. In this work, we present a selection of data sets which were obtained in a measuring campaign performed in the War Heritage Institute in Brussels, Belgium. A continuous monitoring of PM concentration with a light scattering based particle counter was performed. In addition the daily mass concentration and size distribution of airborne PM was monitored by means of Harvard impactors. The chemical composition of sampled PM was inferred from the results of XRF and IC analysis. The insights from these datasets are combined with the results of traditional environmental monitoring (temperature, relative humidity and light intensity), and assessed against the recommended guidelines for conservation environments. By using an integrated approach based on the calculation of an IEQ-index, we present a straightforward methodology to evaluate and visualize the IEQ including also continuous PM monitoring. It is clear from the results of this study how including PM in IEQ analysis allows to identify potential risks for museum collections that remain invisible when only traditional parameters are considered.},

Traditional NO2 gas sensors with highly operated temperatures (200–600 °C) and limited reversibility are mainly constructed from semiconducting oxide-deposited ceramic tubes or inter-finger probes. Herein, we report the functionalized graphene network film sensors assembled on an electrospun three-dimensional (3D) nanonetwork skeleton for ultrasensitive NO2 sensing. The functional 3D scaffold was prepared by electrospinning interconnected polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers onto a nylon window screen to provide a 3D nanonetwork skeleton. Then, the sulfophenyl-functionalized reduced graphene oxide (SFRGO) was assembled on the electrospun 3D nanonetwork skeleton to form SFRGO network films. The assembled functionalized graphene network film sensors exhibit excellent NO2 sensing performance (10 ppb to 20 ppm) at room temperature, reliable reversibility, good selectivity, and better sensing cycle stability. These improvements can be ascribed to the functionalization of graphene with electron-withdrawing sulfophenyl groups, the high surface-to-volume ratio, and the effective sensing channels from SFRGO wrapping onto the interconnected 3D scaffold. The SFRGO network-sensing film has the advantages of simple preparation, low cost, good processability, and ultrasensitive NO2 sensing, all advantages that can be utilized for potential integration into smart windows and wearable electronic devices for real-time household gas sensors.},

	abstract = {The emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) has changed the composition of the atmosphere during the Anthropocene. Accurately documenting the sources and magnitude of GHGs emission is an important undertaking for discriminating the contributions of different processes to radiative forcing. Currently there is no mobile platform that is able to quantify trace gases at altitudes \&lt;100 m above ground level that can achieve spatiotemporal resolution on the order of meters and seconds. Unmanned aerial systems (UASs) can be deployed on-site in minutes and can support the payloads necessary to quantify trace gases. Therefore, current efforts combine the use of UASs available on the civilian market with inexpensively designed analytical systems for monitoring atmospheric trace gases. In this context, this perspective introduces the most relevant classes of UASs available and evaluates their suitability to operate three kinds of detectors for atmospheric trace gases. The three subsets of UASs discussed are: (1) micro aerial vehicles (MAVs); (2) vertical take-off and landing (VTOL); and, (3) low-altitude short endurance (LASE) systems. The trace gas detectors evaluated are first the vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL), which is an infrared laser-absorption technique; second two types of metal-oxide semiconductor sensors; and, third a modified catalytic type sensor. UASs with wingspans under 3 m that can carry up to 5 kg a few hundred meters high for at least 30 min provide the best cost and convenience compromise for sensors deployment. Future efforts should be focused on the calibration and validation of lightweight analytical systems mounted on UASs for quantifying trace atmospheric gases. In conclusion, UASs offer new and exciting opportunities to study atmospheric composition and its effect on weather patterns and climate change.},

	abstract = {Low-cost, light-scattering-based particulate matter (PM) sensors are becoming more widely available and are being increasingly deployed in ambient and indoor environments because of their low cost and ability to provide high spatial and temporal resolution PM information. Researchers have begun to evaluate some of these sensors under laboratory and environmental conditions. In this study, a low-cost, particulate matter sensor (Plantower PMS 1003/3003) used by a community air-quality network is evaluated in a controlled wind-tunnel environment and in the ambient environment during several winter-time, cold-pool events that are associated with high ambient levels of PM. In the wind-tunnel, the PMS sensor performance is compared to two research-grade, light-scattering instruments, and in the ambient tests, the sensor performance is compared to two federal equivalent (one tapered element oscillating microbalance and one beta attenuation monitor) and gravimetric federal reference methods (FEMs/FRMs) as well as one research-grade instrument (GRIMM). The PMS sensor response correlates well with research-grade instruments in the wind-tunnel tests, and its response is linear over the concentration range tested (200–850 μg/m3). In the ambient tests, this PM sensor correlates better with gravimetric methods than previous studies with correlation coefficients of 0.88. However additional measurements under a variety of ambient conditions are needed. Although the PMS sensor correlated as well as the research-grade instrument to the FRM/FEMs in ambient conditions, its response varies with particle properties to a much greater degree than the research-grade instrument. In addition, the PMS sensors overestimate ambient PM concentrations and begin to exhibit a non-linear response when PM2.5 concentrations exceed 40 μg/m3. These results have important implications for communicating results from low-cost sensor networks, and they highlight the importance of using an appropriate correction factor for the target environmental conditions if the user wants to compare the results to FEM/FRMs.},

Tested PM sensors included four low-cost optical sensors, i.e., Sharp, Shinyei, Samyoung and Oneair, TSI DustTrak and Personal Dust Monitor (PDM). A scientific Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance (TEOM; Thermal Scientific Model 1405) was applied as the reference. Same as what concluded in previous studies, our calibration data show that the readouts of all tested PM sensors had linear relationships with the particle mass concentration when the size distribution and composition of test particles were kept unchanged. However, the linear calibration lines for four low-cost PM sensors and DustTrak are different when the size distribution (i.e., mean size and geometrical standard deviation) and composition of particles were varied. The PDM output in general agreed well with that of reference TEOM for particles with mass concentration higher than 300μg/m3. The PDM, however, lost its sensitivity for measuring particles in the mass concentration less than 300μg/m3. Our study also demonstrated that the calibration of low-cost PM sensors should be performed under the condition of steady particle mass concentration instead of under the condition of transient particle concentration, even at very slow transient situation.},

We evaluated the accuracy, bias, and precision of three CAMs (Foobot from Airoxlab, Speck from Carnegie Mellon University, and AirBeam from HabitatMap) for measuring mass concentrations in occupational settings. In a laboratory study, PM2.5 measured with the CAMs and a medium-cost aerosol photometer (personal DataRAM 1500, Thermo Scientific) were compared to that from reference instruments for three aerosols (salt, welding fume, and Arizona road dust, ARD) at concentrations up to 8500µg/m3. Three of each type of CAM were included to estimate precision. Compared to reference instruments, mass concentrations measured with the Foobot (r-value = 0.99) and medium-cost photometer (r-value=0.99) show strong correlation, whereas those from the Speck (r-value range 0.91-0.99) and AirBeam (0.7–0.96) were less correlated. The Foobot bias was (−12\%) for ARD and measurements were similar to the medium-cost instrument. Foobot bias was ({\textless}−46\%) for salt and welding fume aerosols. Speck bias was at 18\% for ARD and −86\% for welding fume. AirBeam bias was (−36\%) for salt and (−83\%) for welding fume. All three photometers had a bias ({\textless}−82\%) for welding fume. Precision was excellent for the Foobot (coefficient of variation range: 5–8\%) and AirBeam (2–9\%), but poorer for the Speck (8–25\%). These findings suggest that the Foobot, with a linear response to different aerosol types and good precision, can provide reasonable estimates of PM2.5 in the workplace after site-specific calibration to account for particle size and composition.},

	abstract = {Sixty-six, new, low-cost Speck monitors were collocated with a Grimm 1.109 particle spectrometer and CO loggers during one indoor and two outdoor monitoring campaigns to assess the ability of the monitors to measure the PM concentrations under real use conditions. The limit of detection of the monitors was calculated, and the monitors’ bias and precision, as well as the results’ reproducibility, were determined. Correlation coefficients of 0.3 and 0.2 observed between the Speck units and the Grimm instrument during indoor and outdoor measurements were increased by separating the data into sets affected by different sources. When the ambient data were divided into combustion and non-combustion aerosol, the mean r2 increased to 0.5 and 0.4 for indoor and outdoor combustion periods data, respectively. Also, averaging the data to improve the signal to noise ratio increases the correlation for low PM concentrations. For outdoor data, the correlation increased to 0.5 when the data were averaged to hourly averages. Between the Specks, the correlation was {\textgreater}0.9 indoors, showing a high degree of reproducibility among the results. The limit of detection was calculated using the method of Wallace et al. (2011) and was found to be 10µgm−3 at a 99\% confidence level for 1-minute data. The mean bias values showed a PM overestimation of 200\% for indoor data, and 500\% for outdoor data relative to the Grimm values. However, these values are influenced by the low measured PM concentrations. The RMSE of Specks was about 10µgm−3 and the concentrations were often about this value. The overall precision was 8.8±1.7\% indoors and 12.2±6.2\% outdoors, suggesting its independence from changing ambient conditions. The Speck monitors may be suitable for use in indoor and outdoor PM monitoring programs, depending on the required performance to meet the goals of the study. The instrument has a large bias at low concentrations, making it unsuitable for background measurements or for measurements in clean environments. Even at concentrations over the LOD, it is necessary to assess the bias for expected particle sources before any instrument deployment.},

These networks can now be supplemented using small portable devices with low-cost sensors for assessment of particle mass that may provide higher temporal and spatial resolution if we understand the capabilities and characteristics of the data they provide.

	abstract = {Household air pollution is ranked the 9th largest Global Burden of Disease risk (Forouzanfar et al., The Lancet 2015). People, particularly urban dwellers, typically spend over 90\% of their daily time indoors, where levels of air pollution often surpass those of outdoor environments. Indoor air quality (IAQ) standards and approaches for assessment and control of indoor air require measurements of pollutant concentrations and thermal comfort using conventional instruments. However, the outcomes of such measurements are usually averages over long integrated time periods, which become available after the exposure has already occurred. Moreover, conventional monitoring is generally incapable of addressing temporal and spatial heterogeneity of indoor air pollution, or providing information on peak exposures that occur when specific indoor sources are in operation. This article provides a review of new air pollution sensing methods to determine IAQ and discusses how real-time sensing could bring a paradigm shift in controlling the concentration of key air pollutants in billions of urban houses worldwide. We also show that besides the opportunities, challenges still remain in terms of maturing technologies, or data mining and their interpretation. Moreover, we discuss further research and essential development needed to close gaps between what is available today and needed tomorrow. In particular, we demonstrate that awareness of IAQ risks and availability of appropriate regulation are lagging behind the technologies.},

Responses to analytes were compared for sensors modified with TNPP and Nf-TNPP composites. Among them, Nf-TNPP exhibited significant responses to H2S and ethanediamine. The analytical performance characteristics of the Nf-TNPP-modified sensor were investigated and the response mechanism is discussed in detail. The sensor exhibited excellent reproducibilities, reversibilities, and selectivities, with detection limits for H2S and ethanediamine of 1 and 10 ppb, respectively, and it is a promising candidate for use in industrial sensing applications.},

	abstract = {The remarkable advances in sensing and communication
technologies have introduced increasingly low-cost, smart
and portable sensors that can be embedded everywhere and play an important role in environmental sensing applications such as air quality monitoring. These user-friendly wireless sensor platforms enable assessment of human exposure to air pollution through observations at high spatial resolution in near-realtime, thus providing new opportunities to simultaneously enhance existing monitoring systems, as well as engage citizens in active
environmental monitoring. However, data quality from such platforms is a concern since sensing hardware of such devices is generally characterized by a reduced accuracy, precision, and reliability. Achieving good data quality and maintaining error free measurements during the whole system lifetime is challenging. Over time, sensors become subject to several sources of unknown and uncontrollable faulty data which comprise the accuracy of the measurements and yield observations far from
the expected values. This paper investigates calibration of lowcost air quality sensors in a real sensor network deployment. The approach leverages on the availability of sensor arrays in a wireless node to estimate parameters that minimize the calibration error using fusion of data from multiple sensors. The obtained results were encouraging and show the effectiveness of the approach compared to a single sensor calibration.},

We measured the detection efficiency of the OPCs by size from 0.5 to 5 µm for monodispersed, polystyrene latex (PSL) spheres. We then compared number and mass concentrations measured with the OPCs to those measured with reference instruments for three aerosols: salt, welding fume, and Arizona road dust. The OPC-N2 detection efficiency was similar to the PAS-1.108 for particles larger than 0.8 µm (minimum of 79\% at 1 µm and maximum of 101\% at 3 µm). For 0.5-µm particles, the detection efficiency of the OPC-N2 was underestimated at 78\%, whereas PAS-1.108 overestimated concentrations by 183\%. The mass concentrations from the OPCs were linear (r ≥ 0.97) with those from the reference instruments for all aerosols, although the slope and intercept were different. The mass concentrations were overestimated for dust (OPC-N2, slope = 1.6; PAS-1.108, slope = 2.7) and underestimated for welding fume (OPC-N2, slope = 0.05; PAS-1.108, slope = 0.4). The coefficient of variation (CV, precision) for OPC-N2 for all experiments was between 4.2\% and 16\%. These findings suggest that, given site-specific calibrations, the OPC-N2 can provide number and mass concentrations similar to the PAS-1.108 for particles larger than 1 µm.Copyright © 2016 American Association for Aerosol Research},

Researchers are examining the sensors for their potential use in a wide range of applications, including the examination of the spatial and temporal variability of particulate matter (PM). However, few studies have quantified the performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, and reliability) of the sensors under real-world conditions. This study examined the performance of two models of PM sensors, the AirBeam and the Alphasense Optical Particle Counter (OPC-N2), over a 12-week period in the Cuyama Valley of California, where PM concentrations are impacted by wind-blown dust events and regional transport. The sensor measurements were compared with observations from two well-characterized instruments: the GRIMM 11-R optical particle counter, and the Met One beta attenuation monitor (BAM). Both sensor models demonstrated a high degree of collocated precision (R2 = 0.8–0.99), and a moderate degree of correlation against the reference instruments (R2 = 0.6–0.76). Sensor measurements were influenced by the meteorological environment and the aerosol size distribution.

	abstract = {A wireless gas sensor node with nanosensor for rapid in-situ detection of ammonia gas is developed and an analytical model for precise and accurate quantification of ammonia in any industrial or closed environment has been proposed. A nanosensor is preferred due to its highly selective and sensitive properties for target gases. In this work, a traditional sensing circuit is replaced with a single sensor based voltage divider sensing circuit for signal feeding to microcontroller. As the room temperature operated chemiresistive ammonia sensor has eliminated the use of micro heater, overall power consumption is reduced. A low sensing power consumption of 56mW was observed and the performance of non-linear model based gas detection algorithm was analysed using Relative Prediction Error (RPE), Root Mean Square Error for Cross Validation (RMSECV) and percentage recovery (\% recovery). Best performance metrics values (RPE=0.04\%, RMSECV=6.128, \% recovery=99.273) were obtained. In addition to this, the wireless sensor node is designed with power harvesting techniques to overcome the issues on node lifetime.},

We measured the detection efficiency of the OPCs by size from 0.5 to 5 µm for monodispersed, polystyrene latex (PSL) spheres. We then compared number and mass concentrations measured with the OPCs to those measured with reference instruments for three aerosols: salt, welding fume, and Arizona road dust. The OPC-N2 detection efficiency was similar to the PAS-1.108 for particles larger than 0.8 µm (minimum of 79\% at 1 µm and maximum of 101\% at 3 µm). For 0.5-µm particles, the detection efficiency of the OPC-N2 was underestimated at 78\%, whereas PAS-1.108 overestimated concentrations by 183\%. The mass concentrations from the OPCs were linear (r ≥ 0.97) with those from the reference instruments for all aerosols, although the slope and intercept were different. The mass concentrations were overestimated for dust (OPC-N2, slope = 1.6; PAS-1.108, slope = 2.7) and underestimated for welding fume (OPC-N2, slope = 0.05; PAS-1.108, slope = 0.4). The coefficient of variation (CV, precision) for OPC-N2 for all experiments was between 4.2\% and 16\%. These findings suggest that, given site-specific calibrations, the OPC-N2 can provide number and mass concentrations similar to the PAS-1.108 for particles larger than 1 µm.Copyright © 2016 American Association for Aerosol Research},

Researchers are examining the sensors for their potential use in a wide range of applications, including the examination of the spatial and temporal variability of particulate matter (PM). However, few studies have quantified the performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, and reliability) of the sensors under real-world conditions. This study examined the performance of two models of PM sensors, the AirBeam and the Alphasense Optical Particle Counter (OPC-N2), over a 12-week period in the Cuyama Valley of California, where PM concentrations are impacted by wind-blown dust events and regional transport. The sensor measurements were compared with observations from two well-characterized instruments: the GRIMM 11-R optical particle counter, and the Met One beta attenuation monitor (BAM). Both sensor models demonstrated a high degree of collocated precision (R2 = 0.8–0.99), and a moderate degree of correlation against the reference instruments (R2 = 0.6–0.76). Sensor measurements were influenced by the meteorological environment and the aerosol size distribution. Quantifying the performance of sensors in real-world conditions is a requisite step to ensuring that sensors will be used in ways commensurate with their data quality.},

In this contribution, we propose and compare different approaches to the calibration problem of novel fast air quality multisensing devices, using two datasets recorded in field.

	abstract = {Chemical multisensor devices need calibration algorithms to estimate gas concentrations. Their possible adoption as indicative air quality measurements devices poses new challenges due to the need to operate in continuous monitoring modes in uncontrolled environments. Several issues, including slow dynamics, continue to affect their real world performances. At the same time, the need for estimating pollutant concentrations on board the devices, especially for wearables and IoT deployments, is becoming highly desirable. In this framework, several calibration approaches have been proposed and tested on a variety of proprietary devices and datasets; still, no thorough comparison is available to researchers. This work attempts a benchmarking of the most promising calibration algorithms according to recent literature with a focus on machine learning approaches. We test the techniques against absolute and dynamic performances, generalization capabilities and computational/storage needs using three different datasets sharing continuous monitoring operation methodology. Our results can guide researchers and engineers in the choice of optimal strategy. They show that non-linear multivariate techniques yield reproducible results, outperforming linear approaches. Specifically, the Support Vector Regression method consistently shows good performances in all the considered scenarios. We highlight the enhanced suitability of shallow neural networks in a trade-off between performance and computational/storage needs. We confirm, on a much wider basis, the advantages of dynamic approaches with respect to static ones that only rely on instantaneous sensor array response. The latter have been shown to be best choice whenever prompt and precise response is needed.},

	abstract = {The recent emergence of low-cost microsensors measuring various air pollutants has significant potential for carrying out high-resolution mapping of air quality in the urban environment. However, the data obtained by such sensors are generally less reliable than that from standard equipment and they are subject to significant data gaps in both space and time. In order to overcome this issue, we present here a data fusion method based on geostatistics that allows for merging observations of air quality from a network of low-cost sensors with spatial information from an urban-scale air quality model. The performance of the methodology is evaluated for nitrogen dioxide in Oslo, Norway, using both simulated datasets and real-world measurements from a low-cost sensor network for January 2016. The results indicate that the method is capable of producing realistic hourly concentration fields of urban nitrogen dioxide that inherit the spatial patterns from the model and adjust the prior values using the information from the sensor network. The accuracy of the data fusion method is dependent on various factors including the total number of observations, their spatial distribution, their uncertainty (both in terms of systematic biases and random errors), as well as the ability of the model to provide realistic spatial patterns of urban air pollution. A validation against official data from air quality monitoring stations equipped with reference instrumentation indicates that the data fusion method is capable of reproducing city-wide averaged official values with an R2 of 0.89 and a root mean squared error of 14.3 μg m−3. It is further capable of reproducing the typical daily cycles of nitrogen dioxide. Overall, the results indicate that the method provides a robust way of extracting useful information from uncertain sensor data using only a time-invariant model dataset and the knowledge contained within an entire sensor network.},

	abstract = {Low-cost sensor technology can potentially revolutionise the area of air pollution monitoring by providing high-density spatiotemporal pollution data. Such data can be utilised for supplementing traditional pollution monitoring, improving exposure estimates, and raising community awareness about air pollution. However, data quality remains a major concern that hinders the widespread adoption of low-cost sensor technology. Unreliable data may mislead unsuspecting users and potentially lead to alarming consequences such as reporting acceptable air pollutant levels when they are above the limits deemed safe for human health. This article provides scientific guidance to the end-users for effectively deploying low-cost sensors for monitoring air pollution and people's exposure, while ensuring reasonable data quality. We review the performance characteristics of several low-cost particle and gas monitoring sensors and provide recommendations to end-users for making proper sensor selection by summarizing the capabilities and limitations of such sensors. The challenges, best practices, and future outlook for effectively deploying low-cost sensors, and maintaining data quality are also discussed. For data quality assurance, a two-stage sensor calibration process is recommended, which includes laboratory calibration under controlled conditions by the manufacturer supplemented with routine calibration checks performed by the end-user under final deployment conditions. For large sensor networks where routine calibration checks are impractical, statistical techniques for data quality assurance should be utilised. Further advancements and adoption of sophisticated mathematical and statistical techniques for sensor calibration, fault detection, and data quality assurance can indeed help to realise the promised benefits of a low-cost air pollution sensor network.},

However, in the diverse applications these sensors face many technological challenges, including sensor drift over long-term deployment that cannot be easily addressed using mathematical correction algorithms or machine learning methods. This study aims to develop a novel approach to auto-correct the drift of commonly used electrochemical nitrogen dioxide (NO2) sensor with comprehensive evaluation of its application. The impact of environmental factors on the NO2 electrochemical sensor in low-ppb concentration level measurement was evaluated in laboratory and the temperature and relative humidity correction algorithm was evaluated. An automated zeroing protocol was developed and assessed using a chemical absorbent to remove NO2 as a means to perform zero correction in varying ambient conditions. The sensor system was operated in three different environments in which data were compared to a reference NO2 analyzer. The results showed that the zero-calibration protocol effectively corrected the observed drift of the sensor output. This technique offers the ability to enhance the performance of low-cost sensor based systems and these findings suggest extension of the approach to improve data quality from sensors measuring other gaseous pollutants in urban air.},

One of the main challenges is the necessary cooperation among different entities such as vehicles or infrastructure systems and how to exploit the information available through networks of sensors deployed as infrastructures for smart cities. In this work an algorithm for cooperative control of urban subsystems is proposed to provide a solution for mobility problems in cities. The interconnected traffic lights controller (TLC) network adapts traffic lights cycles, based on traffic and air pollution sensory information, in order to improve the performance of urban traffic networks. The presence of air pollution in cities is not only caused by road traffic but there are other pollution sources that contribute to increase or decrease the pollution level. Due to the distributed and heterogeneous nature of the different components involved, a system of systems engineering approach is applied to design a consensus-based control algorithm. The designed control strategy contains a consensus-based component that uses the information shared in the network for reaching a consensus in the state of TLC network components. Discrete event systems specification is applied for modelling and simulation. The proposed solution is assessed by simulation studies with very promising results to deal with simultaneous responses to both pollution levels and traffic flows in urban traffic networks.},

	abstract = {Low-cost sensing strategies hold the promise of denser air quality monitoring networks, which could significantly improve our understanding of personal air pollution exposure. Additionally, low-cost air quality sensors could be deployed to areas where limited monitoring exists. However, low-cost sensors are frequently sensitive to environmental conditions and pollutant cross-sensitivities, which have historically been poorly addressed by laboratory calibrations, limiting their utility for monitoring. In this study, we investigated different calibration models for the Real-time Affordable Multi-Pollutant (RAMP) sensor package, which measures CO, NO2, O3, and CO2. We explored three methods: 1) laboratory univariate linear regression, 2) empirical multivariate linear regression and 3) machine-learning based calibration models using random forests (RF). Calibration models were developed for 19 RAMP monitors using training and testing windows spanning August 2016 through February 2017 in Pittsburgh, PA. The random forest models matched (CO) or significantly outperformed (NO2, CO2, O3) the other calibration models, and their accuracy and precision was robust over time for testing windows of up to 16 weeks. Following calibration, average mean absolute error on the testing dataset from the random forest models was 38 ppb for CO (14 \% relative error), 10 ppm for CO2 (2 \% relative error), 3.5 ppb for NO2 (29 \% relative error) and 3.4 ppb for O3 (15 \% relative error), and Pearson r versus the reference monitors exceeded 0.8 for most units. Model performance is explored in detail, including a quantification of model variable importance, accuracy across different concentration ranges, and performance in a range of monitoring contexts including the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), and the US EPA Air Sensors Guidebook recommendations of minimum data quality for personal exposure measurement. A key strength of the RF approach is that it accounts for pollutant cross sensitivities. This highlights the importance of developing multipollutant sensor packages (as opposed to single pollutant monitors); we determined this is especially critical for NO2 and CO2. The evaluation reveals that only the RF-calibrated sensors meet the US EPA Air Sensors Guidebook recommendations of minimum data quality for personal exposure measurement. We also demonstrate that the RF model calibrated sensors could detect differences in NO2 concentrations between a near-road site and a suburban site less than 1.5 km away. From this study, we conclude that combining RF models with the RAMP monitors appears to be a very promising approach to address the poor performance that has plagued low cost air quality sensors.},

	abstract = {Over the past few years, many low-cost pollution sensors have been integrated into measurement platforms for air quality monitoring. However, using these sensors is challenging: concentrations of toxic substances in ambient air often lie at sensors' sensitivity boundaries, environmental conditions affect the sensor measurements, and the sensors often suffer from poor selectivity, i.e. are cross-sensitive to multiple pollutants. Datasheet information on these effects is scarce or may not cover deployment conditions. Consequently the sensors need to undergo extensive pre-deployment testing to examine their feasibility for a given application and to find the optimal measurement setup that allows accurate data collection and calibration. In this work, we propose a novel method to conduct in-field testing of low-cost sensors. The algorithm proposed is based on multiple least-squares and leverages the physical variation of urban air pollution to quantify the amount of explained and unexplained sensor signal. We verify (i) whether a sensor is feasible for air quality monitoring in a given environment and underpin our analysis with positive and negative examples of sensors available on the market, (ii) model sensor cross-sensitivities to interfering gases and environmental effects and (iii) compute the optimal sensor array and its calibration parameters for stable and accurate sensor measurements over long time periods in a given environment. Finally, we provide an experimental evaluation of our approach using over 9 million measurements of various low-cost sensors collected in an urban area. Based on the results from our testing methodology we propose an optimized sensor array setup. Further, we show---compared to a state-of-the-art calibration technique---a significantly lower calibration error with better long-time stability of the calibration parameters.},

	abstract = {The potential of inexpensive Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) gas sensors to be used for urban air quality monitoring has been the topic of increasing interest in the last decade. This paper discusses some of the lessons of three years of experience working with such sensors on a novel instrument platform (Small Open General purpose Sensor (SOGS)) in the measurement of atmospheric nitrogen dioxide and ozone concentrations. Analytic methods for increasing long-term accuracy of measurements are discussed, which permit nitrogen dioxide measurements with 95\% confidence intervals of 20.0     μ g    m  − 3       and ozone precision of 26.8     μ g    m  − 3      , for measurements over a period one month away from calibration, averaged over 18 months of such calibrations. Beyond four months from calibration, sensor drift becomes significant, and accuracy is significantly reduced. Successful calibration schemes are discussed with the use of controlled artificial atmospheres complementing deployment on a reference weather station exposed to the elements. Manufacturing variation in the attributes of individual sensors are examined, an experiment possible due to the instrument being equipped with pairs of sensors of the same kind. Good repeatability (better than 0.7 correlation) between individual sensor elements is shown. The results from sensors that used fans to push air past an internal sensor element are compared with mounting the sensors on the outside of the enclosure, the latter design increasing effective integration time to more than a day. Finally, possible paths forward are suggested for improving the reliability of this promising sensor technology for measuring pollution in an urban environment.},

	abstract = {In many urban areas the population is exposed to elevated levels of air pollution. However, air quality is usually only measured at a few locations. These measurements provide a general picture of the state of the air, but they are unable to monitor local differences. Since a few years new low-cost sensor technology is available, which has the potential to extend the official monitoring network significantly. These sensors, however, are still in an experimental stage and suffer from various technical issues which limit their applicability.  This study explores the added value of alternative air quality measurements, focusing on nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. 16 low-cost air quality sensor devices were built and distributed among volunteers living close to roads with high traffic volume for a two-month measurement campaign.  Careful calibration of individual sensors is essential to measure ambient concentrations of NO2 significantly. Field calibration was done next to an air monitoring station during an 8-day period, resulting in R2 ranging from 0.3 to 0.7. The NO2 accuracy can be improved by including temperature and humidity measurements from an additional low-cost sensor, R2 ranging from 0.6 to 0.9. Recalibration is crucial, as all sensors show significant signal drift after the two-month measurement campaign. The measurement series between the calibration periods can be corrected in hindsight by taking a weighted average of the calibration coefficients.  Validation against an independent air monitoring station shows good agreement. Using our approach, the standard deviation of a typical sensor device for NO2 measurements was found to be 7 μg m−3. This shows that, if properly treated, low-cost sensors based on the current generations of electrochemical NO2 sensors may provide useful complementary data on local air quality in an urban setting.},

	abstract = {Recent developments in sensory and communication technologies have made the development of portable air-quality (AQ) micro-sensing units (MSUs) feasible. These MSUs allow AQ measurements in many new applications, such as ambulatory exposure analyses and citizen science. Typically, the performance of these devices is assessed using the mean error or correlation coefficients with respect to a laboratory equipment. However, these criteria do not represent how such sensors perform outside of laboratory conditions in large-scale field applications, and do not cover all aspects of possible differences in performance between the sensor-based and standardized equipment, or changes in performance over time. This paper presents a comprehensive Sensor Evaluation Toolbox (SET) for evaluating AQ MSUs by a range of criteria, to better assess their performance in varied applications and environments. Within the SET are included four new schemes for evaluating sensors' capability to: locate pollution sources; represent the pollution level on a coarse scale; capture the high temporal variability of the observed pollutant and their reliability. Each of the evaluation criteria allows for assessing sensors' performance in a different way, together constituting a holistic evaluation of the suitability and usability of the sensors in a wide range of applications. Application of the SET on measurements acquired by 25 MSUs deployed in eight cities across Europe showed that the suggested schemes facilitates a comprehensive cross platform analysis that can be used to determine and compare the sensors' performance. The SET was implemented in R and the code is available on the first author's website.},

	abstract = {Recently, a number of optical particulate matter (PM) monitors employing low-cost PM sensors have become available on the consumer market. These portable low-cost monitors can be used to characterize PM concentrations with high spatial and temporal resolution. This study evaluates the performance of four low-cost PM monitors (Speck, Dylos, TSI AirAssure, and UB AirSense) against well-characterized reference instruments, and studies their suitability for PM field exposure studies. The low-cost monitors were characterized in a room-sized laboratory chamber with standard relative humidity and temperature conditions, with two PM sources: cigarette smoke and Arizona Test Dust. This study found that any of the monitors tested perform with adequate precision for monitoring air quality in an indoor microenvironment, although the field calibration of the monitor with a standard instrument for specific types of particles would be required. Other factors such as flexibility in data download methods, connectivity, compatibility with environmental conditions, and quality of technical support should also be considered when selecting low-cost PM monitors for human inhalation exposure assessment studies.},

	abstract = {The poor air quality found in big cities is harmful to human health. The aim of the LIFE PHOTOSCALING Project (LPP) is to assess the effectiveness of different photocatalytic pavements in reducing NO2 pollution. The objective of this preliminary study is to determine how well low cost AQmesh sensors can accurately enough measure NO2 concentrations to be able to determine the effects of using photocatalytic pavements. Data was collected from AQmesh sensors that were installed in two Air Quality Stations in order to monitor NO2 under trafﬁc and urban background conditions. The NO2 measurements were unreliable, resulting in an unsatisfactory level of accuracy. A two-step calibration method was devised in order to overcome this limitation. This method consisted of supervised statistical machine learning regression algorithms. A ﬁrst Multivariate Linear Regression provided a new explanatory variable that contained valuable information about the error. This variable was fed into more sophisticated equations, such as Random Forests, Support Vector Machines and Artiﬁcial Neural Networks. The various models were evaluated by calculating statistics of errors and relative expanded uncertainties, and through Taylor Diagrams. After a careful calibration, AQmesh sensors met the Air Quality Directive’s standards of accuracy at high concentrations of NO2. However, we found that each individual sensor behaves differently and thus, each unit requires the development and application of a speciﬁc calibration model.},

Sensors for CO, CO2, NO2, O3, VOC, PM2.5 and PM10 were integrated on an Arduino Shield compatible board. As concerns PM2.5 and PM10 sensors, the station underwent a laboratory calibration and later a ﬁeld validation. Laboratory calibration has been carried out at the headquarters of CNR-IBIMET in Florence (Italy) against a TSI DustTrak reference instrument. A MATLAB procedure, implementing advanced mathematical techniques to detect possible complex non-linear relationships between sensor signals and reference data, has been developed and implemented to accomplish the laboratory calibration. Field validation has been performed across a full “heating season” (1 November 2016 to 15 April 2017) by co-locating the station at a road site in Florence where an ofﬁcial ﬁxed air quality station was in operation. Both calibration and validation processes returned ﬁne scores, in most cases better than those achieved for similar systems in the literature. During ﬁeld validation, in particular, for PM2.5 and PM10 mean biases of 0.036 and 0.598 µg/m3, RMSE of 4.056 and 6.084 µg/m3, and R2 of 0.909 and 0.957 were achieved, respectively. Robustness of the developed station, seamless deployed through a ﬁve and a half month outdoor campaign without registering sensor failures or drifts, is a further key point.},

The direct reading, aerosol monitoring device, Turnkey, OSIRIS Particle Monitor (Model 2315) and the European reference low volume sampler, LVS3 (Sven/Leckel LVS3) with size-selective inlets for PM10 and PM2.5 fractions were used to assess the comparability of available optical and gravimetric methods for particulate matter characterization in indoor air. Simultaneous 24-hour samples were collected in an indoor environment for 60 sampling periods in the town of Bor, Serbia. The 24-hour mean PM10 levels from the OSIRIS monitor were well correlated with the LVS3 levels (R2 ¼ 0.87) and did not show statistically signiﬁcant bias. The 24-hour mean PM2.5 levels from the OSIRIS monitor were moderately correlated with the LVS3 levels (R2 ¼ 0.71), but show statistically signiﬁcant bias. The results suggest that the OSIRIS monitor provides sufﬁciently accurate measurements for PM10. The OSIRIS monitor underestimated the indoor PM10 concentrations by approximately 12\%, relative to the reference LVS3 sampler. The accuracy of PM10 measurements could be further improved through empirical adjustment. For the ﬁne fraction of particulate matter, PM2.5, it was found that the OSIRIS monitor underestimated indoor concentrations by approximately 63\%, relative to the reference LVS3 sampler. This could lead to exposure misclassiﬁcation in health effects studies relying on PM2.5 measurements collected with this instrument in indoor environments.},

	abstract = {Objective Finely resolved PM2.5 exposure measurements at the level of individual participants or over a targeted geographic area can be challenging due to the cost, size and weight of the monitoring equipment. We propose re-purposing the low-cost, portable and lightweight Shinyei PPD42NS particle counter as a particle counting device. Previous field deployment of this sensor suggests that it captures trends in ambient PM2.5 concentrations, but important characteristics of the sensor response have yet to be determined. Laboratory testing was undertaken in order to characterize performance.
Methods The Shinyei sensors, in-line with a TSI Aerosol Particle Sizer (APS) model 3321, tracked particle decay within an aerosol exposure chamber. Test atmospheres were composed of monodisperse polystyrene spheres with diameters of 0.75, 1, 2 3 and 6 um as well as a polydisperse atmosphere of ASHRAE test dust \#1.
Results Two-minute block averages of the sensor response provide a measurement with low random error, within sensor, for particles in the 0.75–6μm range with a limit of detection of 1 μg/ m3. The response slope of the sensors is idiomatic, and each sensor requires a unique response curve. A linear model captures the sensor response for concentrations below 50 μg/m3 and for concentrations above 50 μg/m3 a non-linear function captures the response and saturates at 800 μg/m3. The Limit of Detection (LOD) is 1 μg/m3. The response time is on the order of minutes, making it appropriate for tracking short-term changes in concentration.
Conclusions When paired with prior evaluation, these sensors are appropriate for use as ambient particle counters for low and medium concentrations of respirable particles ({\textless} 100 ug/m3). Multiple sensors deployed over a spatial grid would provide valuable spatio-temporal variability in},

	abstract = {Health effects attributed to ambient ﬁne particulate matter (PM2.5) now rank it among the risk factors with the highest health burdens in the world, but existing monitoring infrastructure cannot adequately characterize spatial and temporal variability in urban PM2.5 concentrations, nor in human population exposures. The development and evaluation of more portable and affordable monitoring instruments based on low-cost sensors may offer a means to supplement and extend existing infrastructure, increasing the density and coverage of empirical measurements and thereby improving exposure science and control. Here, we report on ﬁeld calibrations of a custom-built, battery-operated aerosol monitoring instrument we developed using low-cost, off-the-shelf optical aerosol sensors. We calibrated our instruments using 1 h and 24 h PM2.5 data from a class III US EPA Federal Equivalent Method (FEM) PM2.5 β-attenuation monitor in continuous operation at a regulatory monitoring site in Oakland, California. We observed negligible associations with ambient humidity and temperature; linear corrections were sufﬁcient to explain 60 \% of the variance in 1 h reference PM2.5 data and 72 \% of the variance in 24 h data. Performance at 1 h integration times was comparable to commercially available optical instruments costing considerably more. These ﬁndings warrant further exploration of the circumstances under which this class of aerosol sensors may proﬁtably be deployed to generate improved PM2.5 data sets.},

	abstract = {Low-cost sensors are effective for measuring the mass concentration of ambient aerosols and second-hand smoke in homes, but their use at concentrations relevant to occupational settings has not been demonstrated. We measured the concentrations of four aerosols (salt, Arizona road dust, welding fume, and diesel exhaust) with three types of low-cost sensors (a DC1700 from Dylos and two commodity sensors from Sharp), an aerosol photometer, and reference instruments at concentrations up to 6500 mg/m3. Raw output was used to assess sensor precision and develop equations to compute mass concentrations. EPA and NIOSH protocols were used to assess the mass concentrations estimated with low-cost sensors compared to reference instruments. The detection efﬁciency of the DC1700 ranged from 0.04\% at 0.1 mm to 108\% at 5 mm, as expected, although misclassiﬁcation of ﬁne and coarse particles was observed. The raw output of the DC1700 had higher precision (lower coefﬁcient of variation, CV D 7.4\%) than that of the two sharp devices (CV D 25\% and 17\%), a ﬁnding attributed to differences in manufacturer calibration. Aerosol type strongly inﬂuenced sensor response, indicating the need for on-site calibration to convert sensor output to mass concentration. Once calibrated, however, the mass concentration estimated with low-cost sensors was highly correlated with that of reference instruments (R2D 0.99). These results suggest that the DC1700 and Sharp sensors are useful in estimating aerosol mass concentration for aerosols at concentrations relevant to the workplace.},

This study evaluates the performance of four low-cost PM monitors (Speck, Dylos, TSI AirAssure, and UB AirSense) against well-characterized reference instruments, and studies their suitability for PM ﬁeld exposure studies. The low-cost monitors were characterized in a room-sized laboratory chamber with standard relative humidity and temperature conditions, with two PM sources: cigarette smoke and Arizona Test Dust. This study found that any of the monitors tested perform with adequate precision for monitoring air quality in an indoor microenvironment, although the ﬁeld calibration of the monitor with a standard instrument for speciﬁc types of particles would be required. Other factors such as ﬂexibility in data download methods, connectivity, compatibility with environmental conditions, and quality of technical support should also be considered when selecting low-cost PM monitors for human inhalation exposure assessment studies.},

	abstract = {Exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) is known as a significant risk factor for mortality and morbidity due to cardiorespiratory causes. Owing to increased interest in assessing personal and community exposures to PM, we evaluated the feasibility of employing a low-cost portable directreading instrument for measurement of ambient air PM exposure. A Dylos DC 1700 PM sensor was collocated with a Grimm 11-R in an urban residential area of Houston Texas. The 1-min averages of particle number concentrations for sizes between 0.5 and 2.5 µm (small size) and sizes larger than 2.5 µm (large size) from a DC 1700 were compared with the 1-min averages of PM2.5 (aerodynamic size less than 2.5 µm) and coarse PM (aerodynamic size between 2.5 and 10 µm) concentrations from a Grimm 11-R. We used a linear regression equation to convert DC 1700 number concentrations to mass concentrations, utilizing measurements from the Grimm 11-R. The estimated average DC 1700 PM2.5 concentration (13.2 ± 13.7 µg/m3) was similar to the average measured Grimm 11-R PM2.5 concentration (11.3 ± 15.1 µg/m3). The overall correlation (r2) for PM2.5 between the DC 1700 and Grimm 11-R was 0.778. The estimated average coarse PM concentration from the DC 1700 (5.6 ± 12.1 µg/m3) was also similar to that measured with the Grimm 11-R (4.8 ± 16.5 µg/m3) with an r2 of 0.481. The effects of relative humidity and particle size on the association between the DC 1700 and the Grimm 11-R results were also examined. The calculated PM mass concentrations from the DC 1700 were close to those measured with the Grimm 11-R when relative humidity was less than 60\% for both PM2.5 and coarse PM. Particle size distribution was more important for the association of coarse PM between the DC 1700 and Grimm 11-R than it was for PM2.5.},

In order to support health impact assessment it is essential to develop a better understanding of individual exposure pathways in people's everyday lives by taking account of all environments in which people spend time. Here we describe the development, validation and results of an exposure method applied in a study conducted in Scotland. A low-cost particle counter based on light-scattering technology — the Dylos 1700 was used. Its performance was validated in comparison with equivalent instruments (TEOM-FDMS) at two national monitoring network sites (R2=0.9 at a rural background site, R2=0.7 at an urban background site). This validation also provided two functions to convert measured PNCs into calculated particle mass concentrations for direct comparison of concentrations with equivalent monitoring instruments and air quality limit values. This study also used contextual and time-based activity data to define six microenvironments (MEs) to assess everyday exposure of individuals to short-term PM2.5 concentrations. The Dylos was combined with a GPS receiver to track movement and exposure of individuals across the MEs. Seventeen volunteers collected 35 profiles. Profiles may have a different overall duration and structure with respect to times spent in different MEs and activities undertaken. Results indicate that due to the substantial variability across and between MEs, it is essential to measure near-complete exposure pathways to allow for a comprehensive assessment of the exposure risk a person encounters on a daily basis. Taking into account the information gained through personal exposure measurements, this work demonstrates the added value of data generated by the application of low-cost monitors.},

	abstract = {Sixty-six, new, low-cost Speck monitors were collocated with a Grimm 1.109 particle spectrometer and CO loggers during one indoor and two outdoor monitoring campaigns to assess the ability of the monitors to measure the PM concentrations under real use conditions. The limit of detection of the monitors was calculated, and the monitors’ bias and precision, as well as the results’ reproducibility, were determined. Correlation coefficients of 0.3 and 0.2 observed between the Speck units and the Grimm instrument during indoor and outdoor measurements were increased by separating the data into sets affected by different sources. When the ambient data were divided into combustion and non-combustion aerosol, the mean r2 increased to 0.5 and 0.4 for indoor and outdoor combustion periods data, respectively. Also, averaging the data to improve the signal to noise ratio increases the correlation for low PM concentrations. For outdoor data, the correlation increased to 0.5 when the data were averaged to hourly averages. Between the Specks, the correlation was {\textgreater}0.9 indoors, showing a high degree of reproducibility among the results. The limit of detection was calculated using the method of Wallace et al. (2011) and was found to be 10µgm−3 at a 99\% confidence level for 1-minute data. The mean bias values showed a PM overestimation of 200\% for indoor data, and 500\% for outdoor data relative to the Grimm values. However, these values are influenced by the low measured PM concentrations. The RMSE of Specks was about 10µgm−3 and the concentrations were often about this value. The overall precision was 8.8±1.7\% indoors and 12.2±6.2\% outdoors, suggesting its independence from changing ambient conditions. The Speck monitors may be suitable for use in indoor and outdoor PM monitoring programs, depending on the required performance to meet the goals of the study. The instrument has a large bias at low concentrations, making it unsuitable for background measurements or for measurements in clean environments. Even at concentrations over the LOD, it is necessary to assess the bias for expected particle sources before any instrument deployment.},

In general, there was moderate spatial inhomogeneity, as indicated by multiple pairwise measures including coefficient of divergence and signed rank tests of the value distributions. Pearson correlation coefficients were often moderate ({\textasciitilde}50\% of units showed correlations {\textgreater}0.5 during the first season), indicating that there was some coherent variation across the area, likely driven by a combination of meteorological conditions (wind speed, direction, and mixed layer heights) and the concentration of PM2.5 being transported into the region. Although the accuracy of these PM sensors is limited, they are sufficiently precise relative to one another and to research grade instruments that they can be useful is assessing the spatial and temporal variations across an area and provide concentration estimates based on higher-quality central site monitoring data.},

	abstract = {Low-cost, light-scattering-based particulate matter (PM) sensors are becoming more widely available and are being increasingly deployed in ambient and indoor environments because of their low cost and ability to provide high spatial and temporal resolution PM information. Researchers have begun to evaluate some of these sensors under laboratory and environmental conditions. In this study, a low-cost, particulate matter sensor (Plantower PMS 1003/3003) used by a community air-quality network is evaluated in a controlled wind-tunnel environment and in the ambient environment during several winter-time, cold-pool events that are associated with high ambient levels of PM. In the wind-tunnel, the PMS sensor performance is compared to two research-grade, light-scattering instruments, and in the ambient tests, the sensor performance is compared to two federal equivalent (one tapered element oscillating microbalance and one beta attenuation monitor) and gravimetric federal reference methods (FEMs/FRMs) as well as one research-grade instrument (GRIMM). The PMS sensor response correlates well with research-grade instruments in the wind-tunnel tests, and its response is linear over the concentration range tested (200–850 μg/m3). In the ambient tests, this PM sensor correlates better with gravimetric methods than previous studies with correlation coefficients of 0.88. However additional measurements under a variety of ambient conditions are needed. Although the PMS sensor correlated as well as the research-grade instrument to the FRM/FEMs in ambient conditions, its response varies with particle properties to a much greater degree than the research-grade instrument. In addition, the PMS sensors overestimate ambient PM concentrations and begin to exhibit a non-linear response when PM2.5 concentrations exceed 40 μg/m3. These results have important implications for communicating results from low-cost sensor networks, and they highlight the importance of using an appropriate correction factor for the target environmental conditions if the user wants to compare the results to FEM/FRMs.},

These monitors (AirBeam, HabitatMap) were compared with the widely used direct-reading particulate matter monitors and a gravimetric reference method for PM2.5. Instruments were tested during 20 monitoring sessions that were subdivided in two different seasons to evaluate the performance of sensors across various environmental and meteorological conditions. Measurements were performed at an urban background site in Como, Italy. To evaluate the performance of the instruments, different analyses were conducted on 8-h averaged PM2.5 concentrations for comparison between direct-reading monitors and the gravimetric method, and minute-averaged data for comparison between the direct-reading instruments. A linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate whether the two measurement methods, when compared, could be considered comparable and/or mutually predictive. Further, Bland-Altman plots were used to determine whether the methods were characterized by speciﬁc biases. Finally, the correlations between the error associated with the direct-reading instruments and the meteorological parameters acquired at the sampling point were investigated. Principal results show a moderate degree of agreement between MMs and the reference method and a bias that increased with an increase in PM2.5 concentrations.},

During outdoor activity, many people have to face the effects of particle pollution in the atmosphere. This is the main cause for respiratory health defects, such as heart, vascular, stroke and lung disease. In order to protect and prevent people from the particle matter area, this research shows the step of implementing the mobile application sensor, while checking sensitivity when it is connected. Using this existing low cost SDS011 sensor with CE, RoHS and FCC standard and testing mobility detects PM10 and PM2.5 value. Moreover, this research plots linear regression graphs to present the trend of the PM that is parallel with the x-axis. This illustration shows the promising performance of the sensor application after only a short period of time collecting data. Not only is this device more convenient than the bigger model due to its small size, but its ability to connect to an app on smart phones makes it ubiquitous. Moreover, we look forward to our future work where multiple devices can be placed next each other in the same areas. This will lead us to make an accurate quarantine area of the air pollution problem. Furthermore, this data can be used in forecasting combined with respiratory, cardiovascular or related diseases.},

The goal of this study was to evaluate the active-ﬂow personal DataRAM for PM2.5 (MIE pDR-1200; Thermo Electron Corp., Franklin, MA) designed as a wearable monitor to continuously measure particle exposure. The instrument precision was found to be good (2.1\%) and signiﬁcantly higher than the passive pDR conﬁguration tested previously. A comparison to other proven continuous monitors resulted in good agreement at low relative humidities. Results at higher humidity followed predictable trends and provided a correction scheme that improved the accuracy of pDR readings. The pDR response to particle size also corresponded to previously observed and theoretical errors. The active ﬂow feature of the pDR allows collection of the sampled particles on a back-up ﬁlter. The 24-h mass measured on this ﬁlter was found to compare very well with a Federal Reference Method for PM2.5 mass.},

	abstract = {Development of an air quality monitoring network with high spatio-temporal resolution requires installation of a large number of air pollutant monitors. However, state-of-the-art monitors are costly and may not be compatible with wireless data logging systems. In this study, low-cost electro-chemical sensors manufactured by Alphasense Ltd. for detection of CO and oxidative gases (predominantly O3 and NO2) were evaluated. The voltages from three oxidative gas sensors and three CO sensors were recorded every 2.5 sec when exposed to controlled gas concentrations in a 0.125-m3 acrylic glass chamber. Electro-chemical sensors for detection of oxidative gases demonstrated sensitivity to both NO2 and O3 with similar voltages recorded when exposed to equivalent environmental concentrations of NO2 or O3 gases, when evaluated separately. There was a strong linear relationship between the recorded voltages and target concentrations of oxidative gases (R2 {\textgreater} 0.98) over a wide range of concentrations. Although a strong linear relationship was also observed for CO concentrations below 12 ppm, a saturation effect was observed wherein the voltage only changes minimally for higher CO concentrations (12–50 ppm). The nonlinear behavior of the CO sensors implied their unsuitability for environments where high CO concentrations are expected. Using a manufacturer-supplied shroud, sensors were tested at 2 different flow rates (0.25 and 0.5 Lpm) to mimic field calibration of the sensors with zero air and a span gas concentration (2 ppm NO2 or 15 ppm CO). As with all electrochemical sensors, the tested devices were subject to drift with a bias up to 20\% after 9 months of continuous operation. Alphasense CO sensors were found to be a proper choice for occupational and environmental CO monitoring with maximum concentration of 12 ppm, especially due to the field-ready calibration capability. Alphasense oxidative gas sensors are usable only if it is valuable to know the sum of the NO2 and O3 concentrations.},

However, the data quality from such systems has not been fully characterized and may not meet user expectations in research and regulatory uses, or for use in citizen science. In our study, electrochemical sensors (Alphasense B4 series) for carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and oxidants (Ox) were evaluated under controlled laboratory conditions to identify the inﬂuencing factors and quantify their relation with sensor outputs. Based on the laboratory tests, we developed different correction methods to compensate for the impact of ambient conditions. Further, the sensors were assembled into a monitoring system and tested in ambient conditions in Hong Kong side-by-side with regulatory reference monitors, and data from these tests were used to evaluate the performance of the models, to reﬁne them, and validate their applicability in variable ambient conditions in the ﬁeld. The more comprehensive correction models demonstrated enhanced performance when compared with uncorrected data. One over-arching observation of this study is that the low-cost sensors may promise excellent sensitivity and performance, but it is essential for users to understand and account for several key factors that may strongly affect the nature of sensor data. In this paper, we also evaluated factors of multi-month stability, temperature, and humidity, and considered the interaction of oxidant gases NO2 and ozone on a newly introduced oxidant sensor.},

	abstract = {Air pollution is a major concern for public health and urban environments. Conventional air pollution monitoring systems install a few highly accurate, expensive stations at representative locations. Their sparse coverage and low spatial resolution are insufﬁcient to quantify urban air pollution and its impacts on human health and environment. Advances in lowcost portable air pollution sensors have enabled air pollution monitoring deployments at scale to measure air pollution at high spatiotemporal resolution. However, it is challenging to ensure the accuracy of these low-cost sensor deployments because the sensors are more error-prone than high-end sensing infrastructures and they are often deployed in harsh environments. Sensor calibration has proven to be effective to improve the data quality of low-cost sensors and maintain the reliability of longterm, distributed sensor deployments. In this article, we review the state-of-the-art low-cost air pollution sensors, identify their major error sources, and comprehensively survey calibration models as well as network re-calibration strategies suited for different sensor deployments. We also discuss limitations of exiting methods and conclude with open issues for future sensor calibration research.},

The field evaluation in an urban roadside environment in comparison to designated monitors showed good agreement with measurement error within 5\% of the pollutant concentrations. Multiple sets of the developed system were then deployed in the Hong Kong Marathon 2015 forming a sensor-based network along the marathon route. Real-time air pollution concentration data were wirelessly transmitted and the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) for the Green Marathon was calculated, which were broadcast to the public on an hourly basis. The route-specific sensor network showed somewhat different pollutant patterns than routine air monitoring, indicating the immediate impact of traffic control during the marathon on the roadside air quality. The study is one of the first applications of a next generation sensor network in international sport events, and it demonstrated the usefulness of the emerging sensor-based air monitoring technology in rapid network deployment to supplement existing air monitoring.},

	abstract = {Air pollution exposure characterization has been shaped by many constraints. These include technologies that lead to insufficient coverage across space and/or time in order to characterize individual or community-level exposures with sufficient accuracy and precision. However, there is now capacity for continuous monitoring of many air pollutants using comparatively inexpensive, real-time sensors. Crucial questions remain regarding whether or not these sensors perform adequately for various potential end uses and whether performance varies over time or across ambient conditions. Performance scrutiny of sensors via lab- and field-testing and calibration across their lifetime is necessary for interpretation of data, and has important implications for end users including cost effectiveness and ease of use. We developed a comparatively lower-cost, portable, in-home air sampling platform and a guiding development and maintenance workflow that achieved our goal of characterizing some key indoor pollutants with high sensitivity and reasonable accuracy. Here we describe the process of selecting, validating, calibrating, and maintaining our platform – the Environmental Multi-pollutant Monitoring Assembly (EMMA) – over the course of our study to-date. We highlight necessary resources and consider implications for communities or researchers interested in developing such platforms, focusing on PM2.5, NO, and NO2 sensors. Our findings emphasize that lower-cost sensors should be deployed with caution, given financial and resource costs that greatly exceed sensor costs, but that selected community objectives could be supported at lesser cost and community-based participatory research strategies could be used for more wide-ranging goals.},
